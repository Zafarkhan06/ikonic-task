00:00:05.376 --> 00:00:07.888
Birds carry avian, or bird flu

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.344
in their intestines.

00:00:09.448 --> 00:00:10.928
Wild migratory birds

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.128
 are not affected,

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.328
but domestic birds get very sick,

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.624
and many die.

00:00:16.128 --> 00:00:18.144
Bird flu spreads among people

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.512
through airborne particles

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:21.448
that enter the mouth or nose.

00:00:21.536 --> 00:00:22.536
People cannot get it

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.416
from eating infected birds.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.672
Only a few people have

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.192
been infected to date:

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.472
uncommon cases of poultry workers

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:30.488
who breathed in dust

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.056
from dried bird feces;

00:00:32.096 --> 00:00:34.152
or a mutated version of the virus

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:35.696
spreading from an infected worker

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.504
to other family members.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.800
Unfortunately symptoms of bird flu

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.168
resemble those of conventional flu,

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.064
sore throat, cough, fever, and muscle aches.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.856
People with bird flu also

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.464
may develop life-threatening complications,

00:00:51.536 --> 00:00:55.328
viral pneumonia, acute respiratory distress.

00:00:55.704 --> 00:00:57.856
Because the infection is rare,

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.080
people have not built up immunity,

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.592
and up to 60% of

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.576
those infected, die.

00:01:03.776 --> 00:01:05.632
This along with the ability

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.544
of the virus to quickly mutate,

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.008
have led scientists to keep

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.008
a very close watch on all known

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.680
cases wherever in the world they appear.
