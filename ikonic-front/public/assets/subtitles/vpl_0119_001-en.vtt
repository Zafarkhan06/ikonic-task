00:00:05.424 --> 00:00:07.808
Colds are caused by a virus.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.840
Your child may catch a cold

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.440
through close contact with someone

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.064
who is coughing or sneezing.

00:00:13.304 --> 00:00:14.664
Your child can also pick up

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.376
the virus by handling objects

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.664
that were touched by someone with a cold. 

00:00:19.064 --> 00:00:20.224

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.184
