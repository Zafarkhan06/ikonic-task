00:00:03.408 --> 00:00:05.032
Food is broken down during

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:06.784
the digestion process.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.624
Fats that you eat are processed

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.008
in your intestines.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.248
They then are taken up

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.352
into the blood stream

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.336
and circulate throughout your body

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.216
to either be used for energy

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:18.184
or stored for later use.

00:00:18.528 --> 00:00:20.152
Fats that reach the liver are

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.920
converted by a chemical process

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.616
into cholesterol.

00:00:25.824 --> 00:00:28.032
There are two types of cholesterol,

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:29.608
good and bad.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.328
High levels of HDL,

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.704
or good cholesterol,

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.376
seem to protect against heart attacks.

00:00:35.736 --> 00:00:38.744
LDL cholesterol, or bad cholesterol,

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.536
sticks to the inside walls of

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.632
arteries and helps form the plaque

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:43.952
that can block blood flow

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.712
to the heart and brain.

00:00:47.144 --> 00:00:49.376
Statins block the chemical reaction

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.352
within the liver

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.592
that leads to production of LDL,

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.392
resulting in reduced LDL

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.432
cholesterol levels in the blood.
