00:00:00.136 --> 00:00:02.888
There are four heart compartments or chambers.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.000
The upper two are the atria,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.160
and the lower two are ventricles.

00:00:07.304 --> 00:00:09.392
Blood comes into the chambers and is

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:10.592
then pumped to the rest of

00:00:10.592 --> 00:00:12.590
the body to supply nourishment.

00:00:12.904 --> 00:00:15.024
The flow of blood inside the heart

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.984
is controlled by four thin, flexible valves

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.496
that open and close with each heartbeat.
