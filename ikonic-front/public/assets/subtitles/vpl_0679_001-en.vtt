00:00:00.416 --> 00:00:02.472
During Week 8 of pregnancy,

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:04.728
or 6 weeks after conception,

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.160
the embryo’s facial features are becoming more defined

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.136
as the brain grows to support the senses,

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.240
such as vision and hearing.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.072
The cerebral cortex in the brain has developed

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.304
and all the cranial nerves, which emerge

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.408
from the brain, are in place.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.608
The arms and legs are growing longer

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.880
and joint development is underway.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.016
Blood is forming in the liver.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.296
The intestines are developing and fill

00:00:29.296 --> 00:00:31.290
the base of the umbilical cord.

00:00:31.536 --> 00:00:33.672
The embryo’s C shaped trunk

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.120
is beginning to straighten;

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.448
it is about half an inch long.
