00:00:00.344 --> 00:00:02.624
Part of managing your diabetes at home

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:04.472
is making good choices.

00:00:04.856 --> 00:00:06.968
Measuring your blood sugar regularly

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.496
can help by showing you how certain foods,

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.264
exercise, and stress

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:12.776
can affect your blood sugar.

00:00:13.008 --> 00:00:14.360
Talk to your healthcare provider

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.952
about how often and when

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:17.248
to check your blood sugar.

00:00:17.464 --> 00:00:19.560
In addition to these regular times,

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.640
you should also check your

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.280
blood sugar when feeling ill,

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.952
especially with symptoms of hypoglycemia,

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:26.448
or low blood sugar.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.072
Testing your blood sugar level

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.280
requires a device

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.352
to prick your finger,

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:31.760
called a lancet,

00:00:32.024 --> 00:00:33.712
a blood glucose meter,

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.160
or glucometer,

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.064
and test strips.

00:00:37.496 --> 00:00:38.608
Here are the steps for

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.416
testing your blood glucose:

00:00:40.648 --> 00:00:41.608
First,

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.088
wash the area youâ€™re going

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.568
to prick with warm water.

00:00:44.696 --> 00:00:46.360
Let it air dry.

00:00:46.888 --> 00:00:48.352
Prick the side of the finger

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:49.432
with the lancet.

00:00:49.776 --> 00:00:52.048
Place a drop of blood on the strip.

00:00:52.312 --> 00:00:54.224
Make sure blood completely covers

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.344
the required area on the strip.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.768
Measure the sugar level from the strip

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.584
with the blood glucose meter.

00:01:01.056 --> 00:01:02.400
When you have a checkup,

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.648
always bring your blood sugar records.

00:01:04.824 --> 00:01:06.648
This enables you and your healthcare

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.544
providers to work most effectively

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:09.328
as a team

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.384
for good diabetes management.
