00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:05.580
Multiple Sclerosis or MS is caused by damage to the

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.760
covering that insulates nerve cells, called the myelin sheath.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.820
When the sheath is damaged

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.560
nerves misfire and cannot transmit signals.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.380
This damage is caused by inflammation,

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.040
which happens when the body's own immune cells

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.120
attack the nervous system.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.500
What causes the immune system to attack

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.980
the nerve cells is unknown.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.440
Because nerves in any part of the brain,

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.340
spinal cord, or eyes can be damaged,

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.780
patients with MS can have symptoms such as pain,

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.200
tingling, numbness, vision and speech impairment,

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.860
and muscle weakness, loss of dexterity, 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.000
movement and balance.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.580
Although there is no cure for MS,

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.820
there are medicines that slow down

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.000
and limit its progression.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.920
Interferon beta works by preventing

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.840
immune cells from getting to the nervous system

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.880
to attack myelin surrounding the nerves.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.100
Beta interferons do not cure MS

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.260
but helps slow the progression of nerve damage MS causes.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.660
One of these drugs is glatiramer acetate.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:17.240
Glatiramer acetate is chemically similar to the myelin sheath,

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.400
so it acts as a decoy.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.520
Making immune cells attack it

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.240
instead of myelin surrounding neurons.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.900
Glatiramer acetate doesn't cure MS,

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.320
but it helps slow its progression

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.880
and helps reduce the nerve damage caused by MS.
