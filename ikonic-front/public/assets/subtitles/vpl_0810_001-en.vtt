00:00:00.816 --> 00:00:03.944
Sleep apnea is a sleep disorder that causes

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.152
pauses in breathing or periods of

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.072
shallow breathing while asleep.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.120
This disrupts the sleep cycle,

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.928
prevents a proper night’s sleep

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.680
and may mean you are not getting enough

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.096
oxygen to your brain and body.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.960
Obstructive sleep apnea

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.488
occurs when the muscles at the

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.120
back of the throat relax

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.464
and block or narrow the airway.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.760
It can also occur if

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.272
you have bone deformities

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:27.912
or larger than normal tissues

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.024
in your nose, mouth, or throat. 

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.432
Symptoms include loud snoring,

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.904
daytime sleepiness, and headaches.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.576
More severe apnea,

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.024
determined by how often

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.640
and how long you don’t breathe,

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.208
may cause or worsen

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.264
high blood pressure and

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:43.856
coronary artery disease.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.320
Treatment for sleep apnea

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.048
may include lifestyle changes,

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.424
such as losing weight or

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.816
changing sleep positions

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.240
or the use of a breathing machine at night.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.984
The most common breathing machine,

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.544
called a Continuous Positive Airway Pressure,

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.136
or CPAP machine,

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:59.792
uses a uses a hose and mask

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.552
or nosepiece to deliver

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:02.928
a steady flow of air.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.416
This air flow helps keep

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:05.592
the airway open

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.192
and breathing regular.
