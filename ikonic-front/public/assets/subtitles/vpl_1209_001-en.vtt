00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.160
When a person has the condition known as aortic stenosis,

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.220
their aortic valve becomes narrow or restricted

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.640
and prevents blood flow from the heart out to the body.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.840
This causes the heart to work harder,

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.880
resulting in an enlarged heart.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.340
The overworked heart may eventually fail

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.880
which is commonly known as heart failure. 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.980
The symptoms of heart failure include:

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.040
Shortness of breath

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.940
Chest pain

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:29.780
Fatigue

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:30.780
Dizziness

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.140
Leg swelling

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.980
Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement or TAVR

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.780
is a minimally invasive procedure for patients with

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.640
severe aortic stenosis

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.560
and is an alternative to open-heart surgery.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.560
The benefits of TAVR are:

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.800
Less invasive

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.480
Shorter hospital stay

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.140
Shorter recovery time

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.400
Less pain

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.460
The TAVR procedure typically takes

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.220
between one to two hours.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.140
A small puncture or incision

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.000
is made through the groin to access an artery,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.560
and a catheter is guided to the location of the valve.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.580
A special device with the valve

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.520
is guided into place inside of your diseased valve

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.100
while your heart is beating.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.920
The old valveâ€™s leaflets are pushed up against

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.040
the walls of the heart and the new valve is inserted.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.920
The new valve begins working right away.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.820
These valves are made of bovine tissue and fabric.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.540
The catheters are taken out

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.200
and a stitch will be placed in your groin.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.520
After the procedure,

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.960
patients can usually go home the same day

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.660
or the following day.

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.800
Some people feel better right away.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.900
For most people,

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.960
it takes a few months to fully recover.
