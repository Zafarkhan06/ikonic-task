00:00:00.192 --> 00:00:02.096
Having the TV or a light on

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:03.664
when you’re trying to go to sleep

00:00:03.688 --> 00:00:05.920
is more than just distracting.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.904
Both can actually affect 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.408
what has been called “the hormone of darkness.”

00:00:11.552 --> 00:00:13.968
This hormone, called melatonin,

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.048
is involved in your daily biological cycles,

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.624
including your sleep cycle

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.976
and patterns of sleeping and waking.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.264
Melatonin is produced by a small,

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:24.976
pine-cone shaped gland

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.720
deep in middle of the brain

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.600
called the pineal gland.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.984
When the pineal gland is producing a lot

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.992
of melatonin and blood levels of the

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.592
hormone are high, you feel sleepy

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.872
and your body temperature lowers to prepare for sleep.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.024
The pineal gland keeps secreting melatonin

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.096
based on what your body perceives as

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.696
the length of night.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.856
So blood levels of melatonin are

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.648
low during the daylight hours

00:00:49.648 --> 00:00:51.640
and peak during the dark.

00:00:51.896 --> 00:00:54.144
And this is based on the amount of light

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.536
hitting the retina of your eye.

00:00:56.712 --> 00:00:58.840
Light on the retina sends a signal

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.576
to a part of the brain called the hypothalamus,

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.208
which coordinates the signals

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.968
of your biological clock.

00:01:05.064 --> 00:01:07.584
When light is hitting the back of your eyes,

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.000
the hypothalamus signals the pineal

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.232
to stop releasing melatonin.

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.200
You wake up and your body temperature starts to rise. 

00:01:16.248 --> 00:01:18.448
A dark room helps you to sleep

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.600
because it increases melatonin production.
