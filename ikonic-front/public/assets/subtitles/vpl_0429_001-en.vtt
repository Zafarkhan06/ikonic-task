00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.392
When a person has COPD

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:04.344
the airway walls are damaged

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.696
and thickened, narrowing the lumen.

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.984
Patients cannot exhale as quickly

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.000
or as easily as they used to.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.048
Goblet cells, which are located

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.640
in these larger airways,

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.056
are enlarged, and they

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:17.728
produce much more mucus.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.888
Leading to a productive cough.

00:00:20.096 --> 00:00:22.240
Significant pathologic features are

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.696
also apparent in the distal airways.

00:00:24.824 --> 00:00:26.480
An inflammatory response

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.376
develops in the small airways

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:29.760
from noxious particles

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.872
and gases in cigarette smoke.

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:33.968
These airways become adenomatous

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.072
and microphages, T-cells

00:00:36.072 --> 00:00:38.070
and neutrophils gather there.

00:00:38.288 --> 00:00:40.664
The activated inflammatory cells

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.568
release a continuous stream of

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.088
inflammatory products

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.664
including elastase,

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.664
collagenase,

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:47.912
and cytokines

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.144
into the walls of the small airways

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.176
and into the airspaces.

00:00:52.296 --> 00:00:54.328
We also see widespread

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.400
alveolar wall destruction.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.624
Alveolar wall destruction

00:00:58.624 --> 00:01:00.620
leads to a reduction in lung

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.192
elastic recoil.

00:01:02.456 --> 00:01:04.144
The remaining alveoli

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.856
increase in size.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.944
The devastating effect of reduced

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.576
elastic recoil becomes more apparent

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.432
as we look at a cross section of

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.144
the small airways.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.464
Small airways normally lack

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.256
cartilaginous support.

00:01:18.432 --> 00:01:20.328
When they are no longer held open

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.024
by the elastic recoil of

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.696
intact alveoli.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.176
The small airways collapse.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.472
Air is trapped within alveoli

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.824
making it difficult for

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.168
patients to exhale fully.
