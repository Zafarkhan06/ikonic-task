00:00:00.224 --> 00:00:01.360
The hair on your scalp

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:03.120
does not grow continuously.

00:00:03.328 --> 00:00:05.944
It has a growth phase, called anagen,

00:00:06.136 --> 00:00:08.864
and a resting phase, called telogen.

00:00:09.328 --> 00:00:11.600
Normally, most hair is in a growth phase,

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.960
which lasts for 3 - 6 years.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.840
About 100 hairs are shed

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.552
from the scalp each day.

00:00:17.816 --> 00:00:20.128
The follicle then rests for several months

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.552
in a telogen state

00:00:21.656 --> 00:00:24.352
before a new anagen hair emerges.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.032
Sometimes this growth cycle is altered

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.752
so that more hairs enter the resting phase,

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.360
and hair shedding is greater than normal.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.488
This problem is called telogen effluvium.
