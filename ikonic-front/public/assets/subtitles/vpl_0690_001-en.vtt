00:00:00.312 --> 00:00:02.896
Diabetes can have many damaging effects

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:05.336
on the legs and feet due to changes

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:07.488
in the blood vessels and nerves.

00:00:07.648 --> 00:00:10.520
You may not feel a cut, blister, or sore

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:11.656
if youâ€™ve lost the feeling

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.024
in your foot due to nerve damage.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.696
These injuries can lead to ulcers or infection.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.440
A diabetic ulcer is a breakdown of

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.992
the skin on an area of the foot.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.936
It may be difficult to heal

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.736
because damage to blood vessels

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.008
prevents it from getting enough blood and oxygen.

00:00:30.808 --> 00:00:33.168
Without treatment, it may progress 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.840
through layers of tissue.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.040
Ultimately the tissue may die,

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.568
and amputation may be necessary.

00:00:39.832 --> 00:00:41.824
People with diabetes are also

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.168
more likely to develop cellulitis,

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.432
a bacterial type of infection.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.376
Cellulitis can affect both

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.752
the skin and the fat underneath.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.400
It usually begins with a tear or break on the skin

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.760
that permits bacteria to enter,

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.368
but a weakened immune system sometimes

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.984
allows it to start when skin has not been broken.
