00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.128
Food is broken down

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.200
during digestion

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.248
by a combination of

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.144
caustic hydrochloric acid

00:00:09.232 --> 00:00:11.512
and an enzyme called pepsin.

00:00:13.344 --> 00:00:14.880
The stomach and small intestine

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:15.824
are protected from these

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.432
chemicals by special cells

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.896
that secrete mucous.

00:00:19.808 --> 00:00:21.648
A peptic ulcer occurs

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.168
this protective mechanism

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.584
fails for some reason,

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:25.928
and these chemicals damage

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.840
the stomach and small intestine.
