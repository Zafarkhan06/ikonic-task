00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.900
Ulcerative colitis is a type of inflammatory bowel disease.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.040
Ulcerative colitis causes inflammation and sores

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.840
in just the lining of the large intestine and rectum.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.460
The inflammation is usually uniform and continuous.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.080
Symptoms of ulcerative colitis include

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.780
diarrhea, often with blood or mucus,

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.660
rectal bleeding, abdominal cramps and pain,

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.900
fatigue, and stool urgency.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.680
Most people with ulcerative colitis have mild to moderate symptoms

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.840
and some have periods of remission.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.160
Ulcerative colitis can be debilitating

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.380
and sometimes may lead to life-threatening complications.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.720
There is no cure for ulcerative colitis,

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.460
but treatment can reduce its signs and symptoms

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.040
and offer long-term remission.
