00:00:00.968 --> 00:00:02.624
A normal heartbeat begins

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:04.120
with a group of specialized

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:05.648
pacemaker cells called the

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.112
sinoatrial node

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:08.096
 in the heart’s upper,

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:09.912
right chamber, or atrium.

00:00:10.232 --> 00:00:12.240
Regular electrical impulses

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.184
from these cells

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.080
cause the atria to contract

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.152
or squeeze,

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:17.336
pushing blood into the

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.528
lower chambers or ventricles.

00:00:19.712 --> 00:00:22.072
Traveling down to a junction called

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.880
 the atrioventricular, or AV node

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.664
and on to the ventricles,

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.536
these impulses then signal

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.584
the ventricles to contract.

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:32.936
This pumps blood out to the lungs

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.424
and the rest of the body.

00:00:34.664 --> 00:00:37.304
Ventricular Fibrillation, or Vfib,

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.720
means the electrical impulse in the heart

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.744
is no longer coordinated.

00:00:42.216 --> 00:00:44.400
Normal contraction of the ventricles

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.728
is replaced with heart muscle quivering,

00:00:46.872 --> 00:00:48.152
and when contraction of the

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.152
heart muscles is not coordinated,

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.376
blood can’t be pumped to the body.
