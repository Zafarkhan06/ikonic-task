00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:03.750
Your heart,

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.580
like any other muscle in your body,

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.400
needs oxygen and nutrients to survive.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.590
The coronary arteries carry blood

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:11.870
containing this oxygen

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:13.450
and nutrients to the heart.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.360
If these arteries become blocked,

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.090
an artery or vein from another

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:18.530
part of the body can be used

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.560
to build a detour for blood flow.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:22.770
This is most commonly done

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:24.510
through open-chest surgery,

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.890
but a minimally invasive technique,

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.870
which involves smaller incisions,

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:30.250
may also be used.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:31.400
In some cases,

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.530
usually in open heart surgery,

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.700
a heart-lung machine is used to

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.190
bypass the heart.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.220
The procedure is often referred to

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.410
as a CABG,

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.750
for Coronary Artery Bypass Graft.
