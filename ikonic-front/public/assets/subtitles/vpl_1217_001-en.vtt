00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.720
Anxiety is the very real and normal emotion

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.580
we feel in a stressful situation.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.300
It's related to fear.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.360
But while fear is a response to an

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.720
immediate threat that quickly subsides,

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.800
anxiety is a response to more

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.040
uncertain threats that tends to last much longer.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.960
It's all part of the threat detection system,

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.100
which all animals have to some degree,

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.220
to help protect us from predators.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.520
Our muscles tense,

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.500
our breathing and heart rate increase

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.600
and our blood pressure rises.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.900
This is the fight-or-flight response.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.500
With anxiety, these threat-detection systems

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.260
are functioning incorrectly

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.500
and cause us to worry about

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.940
the future and our safety in it.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.480
For people with an anxiety disorder,

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.720
the anxiety does not go away

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.760
and can get worse over time.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.480
Disrupting work, school and relationships

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.420
and leads them to avoid situations

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.080
that may trigger symptoms.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.600
Anxiety disorders are not at all uncommon.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.280
Researchers estimate that about

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.940
16 percent of individuals currently have

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.640
or have had an anxiety disorder.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.500
Common symptoms of anxiety include:

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.920
Feeling nervous, restless or tense

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.340
Increased heart rate 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.560
Breathing rapidly

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.080
Sweating or trembling

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.600
Trouble sleeping

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.280
Studies have shown that people with

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.340
anxiety disorders don't just have a

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.580
different way of reacting to stress.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.580
There may be actual differences

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.420
in how their brain is working.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.760
The pathways in the brain that

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.060
signal anxiety become stronger.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.300
And the more anxiety you have,

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.260
the stronger the pathways become,

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.800
and it becomes a vicious cycle.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.760
The good news is there's treatment for anxiety.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.540
Cognitive behavioral therapy,

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.040
a form of talk therapy,

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.720
can help you learn to identify

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.360
upsetting thoughts and determine

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.720
whether they're realistic.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:53.560
Over time, 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.360
cognitive behavioral therapy can

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.100
rebuild those neural pathways

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.720
that tamp down the anxiety response.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.900
Medication can also give relief,

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.520
anti-anxiety medication

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.780
and anti-depressants

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.380
are most commonly used to help

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.480
control symptoms that are going into overdrive.

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.760
Talk with your healthcare provider to determine

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.880
the treatment thatâ€™s right for you.
