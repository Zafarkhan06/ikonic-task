00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.140
patients with irregular heart beats,

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.360
called atrial fibrillation,

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.740
are at an increased risk for blood clots

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.740
in the appendage of the heart.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.120
These blood clots can leave the heart

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.660
and travel to other organs

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.500
such as the brain and cause a stroke.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.000
Blood thinners can be used effectively

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.620
but there are some patients

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.000
who cannot tolerate this therapy.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.320
For these patients,

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.180
a left atrial appendage occlusion device

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.700
is an acceptable alternative.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.880
Overtime the bodies own tissue

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.820
grows over the device.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.960
Preventing formation of blood clots and stroke in the future.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.720
The left atrial appendage procedure usually take 1-2 hours

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.400
and most often is done under general anesthesia.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.920
During implantation of the left atrial appendage occlusion device

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.980
a groin puncture is made

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.340
and a catheter is inserted into a vein in your leg

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.020
and threaded up into your heart.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.460
The device is thread through the catheter into the heart.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.000
And once in the heart, it opens like a parachute,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.840
and permanently seals off the left atrial appendage.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.240
Blood thinning medications are continued

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.220
for a period of time.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.800
After the procedure,

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.400
patients can usually go home the same day

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.480
or the following day.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.360
You will be ready for discharge

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.320
when your blood pressure and heart rhythm are stable,

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.840
you can get out of bed with minimal assistance,

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.780
and your groin sites are stable.
