00:00:00.544 --> 00:00:02.936
During Week 6 of pregnancy,

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.088
or 4 weeks after conception,

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.128
the neural groove down the center of the embryo

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.712
closes like a zipper,

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:11.400
forming a tube that becomes

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.664
the spinal cord and brain.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.152
The closing is faster toward the head end

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.608
as the different parts of the brain develop.

00:00:18.736 --> 00:00:21.280
The ends of the groove then close.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.136
The heart now beats and pumps blood.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.152
Other organs and facial features are

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:27.712
becoming more defined.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.896
Tiny buds appear that will become

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.408
arms and legs.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.672
The embryo starts to take on the shape of a C;

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.768
its skin is so thin, it is transparent.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.528
It is about an eighth of an inch long.
