00:00:00.312 --> 00:00:03.544
Gingivitis means inflammation of the gums.

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.952
It most commonly develops in response

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:08.016
to the biofilm called plaque,

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.968
which is made up of bacteria.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.328
Once the bacteria are anchored,

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.720
they bind to other bacteria floating

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.840
around the mouth to form a kind of web.

00:00:17.984 --> 00:00:19.544
As the web grows,

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.016
it can hold onto more bacteria 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:23.968
and the plaque thickens.

00:00:24.096 --> 00:00:26.376
When the plaque is allowed to build up,

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.000
it attracts more types of bacteria.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.304
Over time, it hardens at the base of the teeth

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.904
into a material called tartar.

00:00:34.992 --> 00:00:37.904
The plaque and tartar irritate the gums.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.600
The immune system sends white blood cells

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.184
to fight the bacteria,

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.824
and the gums become inflamed.

00:00:44.952 --> 00:00:47.760
Chronic inflammation causes pockets

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.592
to form where the gums and teeth separate.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.208
As plaque spreads below the gum line,

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.472
bone and tissue can start to break down.

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.504
Active inflammation may contribute

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.504
to formation of clots in blood vessels.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.864
Bacteria entering the blood stream

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.264
activate platelets and increase clotting factors,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.104
which work with platelets to form blood clots.
