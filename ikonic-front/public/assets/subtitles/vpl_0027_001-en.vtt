00:00:03.056 --> 00:00:05.944
Not all painful headaches are migraines.

00:00:06.184 --> 00:00:07.936
Migraine symptoms include:

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:09.992
throbbing on one side of the head;

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.576
feeling sick to your stomach or vomiting;

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.752
and numbness or tingling of your face,

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:16.288
hands, or arms.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.208
Some people see an aura:

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.816
spots, wavy lines,

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:20.808
or flashes of light

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.944
shortly before the pain begins.

00:00:23.152 --> 00:00:24.464
Migraines typically last

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.192
between 4 and 72 hours.

00:00:27.632 --> 00:00:29.624
Migraines run in families,

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:31.920
but their exact cause is unknown.

00:00:32.208 --> 00:00:33.544
Blood vessels in the brain

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.456
may get wider or narrower,

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.456
causing swelling and pain.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.632
Migraines are a serious condition,

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:40.656
and your doctor should be

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.392
consulted for treatment.
