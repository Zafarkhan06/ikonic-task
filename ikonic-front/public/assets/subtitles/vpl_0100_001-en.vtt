00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.768
In vitro fertilization

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.872
means that fertilization takes place

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:06.128
in a laboratory

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.864
instead of in the woman.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.896
The eggs and sperm are collected

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:12.488
and placed in a dish where

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.680
sperm fertilizes the eggs.

00:00:15.384 --> 00:00:18.240
Two to five days after fertilization,

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.896
the best eggs are chosen to be

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.488
implanted in the woman

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.568
and pregnancy proceeds.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.776
Remaining eggs may be

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.736
frozen for future use.
