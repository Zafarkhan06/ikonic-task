00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.500
The first step in total hip replacement

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.610
is removal of damaged cartilage and bone.

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:08.460
A tool called a reamer

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.830
is used to prepare the acetabulum,

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:13.190
the cup-shaped hollow in the hipbone,

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:16.600
to receive the new socket of the hip replacement.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.830
This metal and plastic socket

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.080
called an acetabular component

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.910
is fitted into the healthy bone and tissue.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.140
The outer metal part of this component,

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.640
sometimes called a cup,

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.170
fits directly into the socket.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.570
The plastic portion has a hollow

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.460
to hold the femoral replacement

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.830
at the top of the thighbone or femur.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.200
The outer, metal part is rough

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.280
to help bone grow into its surface over time

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.130
to stabilize the artificial joint.
