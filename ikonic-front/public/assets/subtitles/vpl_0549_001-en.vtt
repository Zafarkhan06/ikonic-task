00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.904
The ventricles are the bottom

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.176
two chambers of our

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:04.744
four-chambered heart.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.008
The left ventricle receives blood

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.488
containing oxygen from the

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.224
left atrium above it,

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.720
and pumps the blood into the aorta,

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.120
which carries it to the rest of the body.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.504
Left ventricular hypertrophy

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.552
is enlargement of the muscle tissues

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.880
in the wall of the left ventricle.

00:00:22.304 --> 00:00:25.136
The most common cause is high blood pressure,

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.040
which forces the ventricle to work

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.512
harder to pump blood to your body.

00:00:29.832 --> 00:00:31.936
The increased work load causes

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.728
the muscular walls of the ventricle

00:00:33.728 --> 00:00:37.056
to become thicker, stiffer and less elastic.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.160
As a result, the ventricle

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.328
can have trouble filling properly,

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.840
and its blood vessels may be compressed,

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.616
reducing the flow of blood to the muscle.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.056
and the muscle may also become weaker.
