00:00:00.624 --> 00:00:02.456
Your gallbladder is a small,

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:03.728
pear-shaped sac

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.496
under the right side of the liver

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.456
in the upper right abdomen.

00:00:07.648 --> 00:00:09.280
It stores and releases

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.512
a digestive liquid

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.064
produced by the liver called bile.

00:00:13.272 --> 00:00:15.736
Laparoscopic cholecystectomy

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:17.880
is a surgical procedure to remove

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.032
the gallbladder,

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:20.560
usually because of pain

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.496
from hardened deposits of bile

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:24.224
called gallstones.

00:00:24.456 --> 00:00:26.928
Small incisions are made in the abdomen,

00:00:26.984 --> 00:00:29.176
and surgical instruments and a tiny

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.080
camera to view the procedure are inserted.

00:00:32.264 --> 00:00:34.704
The gallbladder is held and moved

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.960
 to expose the cystic duct,

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.048
which takes bile

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.040
to and from the gallbladder,

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.576
and the cystic artery,

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.568
which supplies blood to the gallbladder

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.008
and cystic duct.

00:00:45.208 --> 00:00:47.576
Connective tissue is dissected

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:48.912
and the cystic duct

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.040
is clipped several times.

00:00:51.152 --> 00:00:53.136
A cut is made between the clips

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:54.912
to free the gallbladder.

00:00:55.088 --> 00:00:56.536
The cystic artery

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.448
is also clipped and cut.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.512
Because the gallbladder is attached

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.280
to the right lobe of the liver,

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.160
it also has to be dissected

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.664
before being removed,

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.848
along with any gallstones.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.336
After the gallbladder has been removed,

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.424
a drain may be inserted to prevent

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.504
accumulation of fluid at the surgical site.
