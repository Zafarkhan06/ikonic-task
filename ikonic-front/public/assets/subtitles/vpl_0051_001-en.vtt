00:00:02.104 --> 00:00:04.736
Gastric bypass is a surgical procedure

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:06.720
that achieves rapid weight loss

00:00:06.912 --> 00:00:08.720
by “rerouting” digestion

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.160
from the entire stomach

00:00:10.224 --> 00:00:11.720
to a smaller pouch,

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.520
and from the upper intestine

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:14.344
to the middle part

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.944
of the small intestines. 

00:00:17.008 --> 00:00:19.096
The most common form of this procedure

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.496
is the Roux-en-Y bypass.

00:00:24.488 --> 00:00:26.056
The stomach pouch is created

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.952
by stapling

00:00:27.272 --> 00:00:29.112
or placing an elastic band

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:30.064
just below where the

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.704
esophagus enters the stomach,

00:00:32.104 --> 00:00:33.672
and is then connected to the middle

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.688
part of the small intestines.

00:00:38.584 --> 00:00:39.880
This procedure reduces

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.264
the size of the stomach

00:00:41.424 --> 00:00:43.056
and bypasses portions of the

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.880
digestive tract where most calories

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.736
are processed and absorbed.
