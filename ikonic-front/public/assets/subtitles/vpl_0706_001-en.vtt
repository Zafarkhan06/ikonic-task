00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200
Osteoarthritis is a kind of arthritis caused

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.680
by damage to cartilage

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.960
and surrounding tissues in a joint.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.672
Osteoarthritis can develop

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.072
in almost any joint,

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.856
and it commonly occurs in the knee.

00:00:13.384 --> 00:00:15.904
Four bones come together at the knee,

00:00:15.904 --> 00:00:17.900
the shinbone, or tibia,

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.880
the fibula, which runs along side the tibia,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.752
the thighbone, or femur,

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.936
and the patella, or kneecap.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.704
The knee joint itself is made up of the patella,

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.440
tibia, and femur.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.272
Normally, the ends of the femur,

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.312
and tibia and back of the patella

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.496
are covered by smooth cartilage,

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.360
it acts like a cushion between the bones.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.112
The cartilage also provides a smooth surface

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.728
for the interactive movements of the bones.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.200
In osteoarthritis, the cushioning cartilage wears down. 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.424
It can fray, tear, or even wear entirely away.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.200
The pressure on the ends of the bones increases,

00:00:55.232 --> 00:00:57.952
and they may begin to rub against each other.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.224
This can cause the ends of the bones to get thin.

00:01:02.024 --> 00:01:04.496
New growths of bone, called spurs,

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:06.504
can form around the joint edges

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.360
as your body tries to redistribute

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.344
the weight to the damaged joint.

00:01:10.504 --> 00:01:12.968
The space between the joint narrows.

00:01:13.936 --> 00:01:17.080
Small holes can develop in the ends of the bone.

00:01:17.176 --> 00:01:19.408
Small pieces of cartilage or bone

00:01:19.408 --> 00:01:21.400
can break off and float around in the

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.880
tissue capsule surrounding the joint.

00:01:24.104 --> 00:01:25.928
All of these changes can cause

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.824
pain and loss of function in the knee joint.
