00:00:00.256 --> 00:00:02.152
The adrenal glands are located

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:03.760
on top of the kidneys.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.568
They are about 3 inches long

00:00:05.568 --> 00:00:07.560
and shaped like triangles.

00:00:07.856 --> 00:00:09.848
The adrenal glands release different

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.904
classes of hormones that control

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.824
many of your bodyâ€™s functions.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.680
When confronted by stress,

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.080
the brain stimulates the adrenal glands

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.744
to release hormones to help you cope.

00:00:20.744 --> 00:00:22.740
The outer portion of the gland,

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.064
known as the cortex, produces cortisol.

00:00:26.248 --> 00:00:28.680
Effects of increased cortisol include

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.480
heightened memory and a burst of energy.

00:00:31.632 --> 00:00:34.296
The center portion, known as the medulla,

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.184
produces epinephrine and norepinephrine,

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.536
also known as adrenaline and noradrenaline.

00:00:40.736 --> 00:00:42.688
Effects of these hormones include

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.104
increased heart rate and dilation of the pupils. 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.672
The hormones produced by the adrenal glands

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.696
also help to control blood pressure,

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.272
sweating, and other activities regulated

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.040
by the sympathetic nervous system

00:00:55.048 --> 00:00:56.656
in response to stress.
