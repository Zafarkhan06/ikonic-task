00:00:00.264 --> 00:00:02.296
The body produces antibodies

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:04.760
to protect us from outside organisms,

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.752
but occasionally it can work against

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.184
one of its own organs.]

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.168
The thyroid gland is an organ

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.680
sometimes attacked by antibodies.

00:00:12.808 --> 00:00:15.560
When antibodies attack the thyroid gland,

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.456
the resulting condition is called

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.640
Hashimotoâ€™s thyroiditis

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.616
named after the Japanese surgeon,

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.568
Hakaru Hashimoto.

00:00:23.968 --> 00:00:25.856
In Hashimotoâ€™s disease,

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.688
the thyroid gland is slowly destroyed,

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.096
resulting in an enlargement of the gland,

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.216
a lowering of thyroid function,

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.840
and a reduced production of its

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.248
important hormone, thyroxin.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.368
Surgical reduction or removal of the gland

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.584
and medical replacement of thyroxin

00:00:42.592 --> 00:00:44.040
is the usual treatment.
