00:00:00.584 --> 00:00:02.568
Normal blood clotting seals

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.776
blood vessels damaged by an injury

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.688
to help stop blood loss.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.504
But sometimes blood clots

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.216
block blood and oxygen from

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.032
flowing through a blood vessel.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.184
An embolus is a blood clot that

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.712
breaks off, travels through the bloodstream,

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.024
gets stuck in a smaller blood vessel

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.096
and blocks the blood supply.

00:00:21.312 --> 00:00:23.288
A thrombus is a blood clot that

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.096
partially or completely blocks

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:26.680
a vein or artery.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.840
Blood clots may form more easily

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.520
if your blood flows very slowly

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.688
through your veins because of inactivity,

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.296
heart disease, or problems with your veins.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.104
Smoking and some medicines

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.144
can also increase your risk.
