Pesticides are designed to kill pests

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.016
but they can also present potential risks to you.

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:09.864
One potential source of pesticide exposure is your diet.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.224
If you eat a food such as strawberries

00:00:12.224 --> 00:00:14.220
that has pesticide residue,

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.680
it goes into your stomach along with the strawberry.

00:00:17.872 --> 00:00:19.584
After being broken down and

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.432
absorbed in the small intestine,

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.944
tiny particles move into your bloodstream

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.080
to be carried throughout your body.

00:00:26.168 --> 00:00:29.848
Potential health effects depend on the type of pesticide.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.064
For example, there may be cardiovascular signs

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.120
like an increased heart rate and high blood pressure.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.096
The pupils may become dilated,

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.008
resulting in blurry vision.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.280
Exposure sometimes results in bronchoconstriction,

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.224
which means the airways narrow

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.960
as in an asthma attack.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.704
There are many other possible symptoms.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.856
They also vary depending upon the

00:00:51.856 --> 00:00:53.850
type and level of exposure,

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.800
and your size and health.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.968
You can reduce the amount of pesticides

00:00:57.968 --> 00:00:59.960
you consume by washing,

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.488
peeling, and trimming fruits and vegetables

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.488
and eating a variety of foods

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.472
from a variety of sources.
