00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.096
Before birth, the baby grows

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.544
and develops in the uterus, or womb.

00:00:05.672 --> 00:00:07.568
The birthing process begins with

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.752
regular contractions of the uterus

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.464
and dilation, or opening of the cervix,

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:13.800
the narrow opening where

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.752
the uterus joins the vagina.

00:00:16.072 --> 00:00:18.248
When the cervix is fully dilated

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.648
at 10 centimeters,

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.312
around 4 inches,

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:22.984
uterine contractions become

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.000
stronger and more frequent.

00:00:25.152 --> 00:00:26.784
The baby goes through a series

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:28.056
of passive movements,

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.624
especially the head.

00:00:29.864 --> 00:00:31.560
Birth stations indicate

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.048
how low the baby’s head

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.320
can be felt in the mother’s pelvis.

00:00:35.568 --> 00:00:37.216
The baby’s head then begins

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.064
its passage out of the vagina

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.376
called crowning.

00:00:40.624 --> 00:00:42.192
Labor continues

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.920
as the baby’s head and body

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.272
pass out of the womb and vagina.
