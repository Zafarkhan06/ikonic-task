00:00:00.424 --> 00:00:02.224
Since 1824,

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.560
doctors have recommended

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:04.880
cod liver oil,

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.160
a potent source of Vitamin D,

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.200
to build strong bones in children

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.488
who are not exposed to much sunlight.

00:00:11.744 --> 00:00:13.856
Other dietary sources for this

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:15.648
important vitamin include:

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.048
fatty fish, eggs,

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.512
fortified milk

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:20.976
and orange juice.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.304
All Vitamin D begins with sunlight.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.592
For example,

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.304
the Vitamin D we get from fish

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.104
comes from algae they ate

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.504
that made Vitamin D from sunlight.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.720
We also make our own Vitamin D from sunlight.

00:00:35.912 --> 00:00:37.592
When your skin is exposed

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:38.552
to the sun,

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.920
ultraviolet rays convert a form of

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.392
cholesterol in the upper layer of skin

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.992
into Vitamin D.

00:00:45.272 --> 00:00:46.848
All Vitamin D has to be

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.008
converted into an active form

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.672
by your liver and kidneys

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.568
before your body can use it.

00:00:52.864 --> 00:00:55.288
The primary job of this active form,

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.016
called calcitriol,

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.904
is to regulate your bodyâ€™s levels of

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.824
calcium and phosphorous.

00:01:01.256 --> 00:01:04.656
Calcitriol stimulates your body to absorb calcium,

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.544
which also increases phosphorous absorption.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.584
It also stimulates the breakdown of old bone,

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.856
releasing calcium and phosphorous,

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.824
and the building of new bone. 

00:01:15.064 --> 00:01:16.456
Where you live,

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.472
the amount of sunlight each day,

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.624
and how long your skin is exposed

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.392
all affect how much Vitamin D you produce.

00:01:23.712 --> 00:01:25.392
People with more melanin

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:26.848
or pigment in their skin

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.960
need longer exposure than those with less melanin,

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.104
which acts as a light filter.
