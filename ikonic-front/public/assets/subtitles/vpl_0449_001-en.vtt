00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.120
The kidneys are bean-shaped organs

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.056
in your back under your ribs.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.848
Part of the urinary system,

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.384
they filter extra water and

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:08.480
wastes from the blood

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:09.648
to produce urine.

00:00:09.816 --> 00:00:11.520
Urine passes from the kidneys

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.288
to the bladder through the ureters,

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.520
and from the bladder

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.752
through the urethra to leave the body.

00:00:16.968 --> 00:00:19.032
Kidney stones or calculi

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:20.952
are mineral and salt deposits

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.848
that form inside the kidneys.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.920
They build up in layers over time

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.960
and can be the size of a grain of sand,

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.384
a pearl or even a golf ball.

00:00:29.496 --> 00:00:31.512
Small stones can stay in the kidney,

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.992
or pass easily without causing problems.

00:00:34.112 --> 00:00:36.592
A larger stone can get stuck in the ureter,

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.392
bladder or urethra,

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:39.832
block the flow of urine

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.608
and be extremely painful.

00:00:41.728 --> 00:00:43.448
When a stone does not pass,

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.288
it may be treated with shock waves

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.408
or lithotripsy,

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.032
directed from outside or inside your body,

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.728
which break the stones into smaller

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.280
pieces that can pass.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.600
Other treatment may involve using a scope

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.104
to explore the urethra,

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.624
bladder and ureters

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:58.784
or less often

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.480
an open surgical procedure

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.192
to find and remove the stone.
