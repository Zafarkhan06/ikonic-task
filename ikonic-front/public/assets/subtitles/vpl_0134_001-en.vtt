00:00:00.136 --> 00:00:02.080
Jaundice refers to yellowing of

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.416
the skin and other areas of the body

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.168
due to the buildup of a chemical

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.592
called bilirubin.

00:00:08.056 --> 00:00:09.904
As part of normal health,

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.280
the red blood cells in your child’s body

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.704
break down and release

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.680
bilirubin into the blood.

00:00:15.952 --> 00:00:18.768
The liver uses bilirubin to make bile,

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.048
which helps the body digest food

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.760
and absorbs fats and some vitamins.

00:00:23.904 --> 00:00:25.528
If there is a problem moving

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.184
bilirubin out of the liver,

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.944
or a higher than normal number of

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.960
red blood cells are breaking down,

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.320
your child’s skin,

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.824
the white part of the eye,

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.600
or mucus membrane may appear yellow.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.208
Specific causes of jaundice include:

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.568
Liver disease, such as hepatitis

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.008
Bile duct disease, such as biliary atresia

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.416
Blood problems, such as anemia

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:48.880
Certain medicines,

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.704
