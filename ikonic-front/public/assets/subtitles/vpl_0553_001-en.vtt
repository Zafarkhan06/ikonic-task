00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.368
Alzheimer’s disease is believed to affect

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.792
more than 5 million Americans.

00:00:05.072 --> 00:00:06.856
Although the cause is not known,

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.072
the symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease result

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:10.832
from degradation of nerve cells

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.400
in the brain, called neurons.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.512
The human body produces protein

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.768
fragments called amyloid.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.816
In a healthy brain, protein fragments called

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.320
beta amyloid are broken down and eliminated.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.992
In Alzheimer’s disease,

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.048
these fragments accumulate into hard plaque.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.536
The plaques accumulate between nerve cells

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.144
and inhibit transmission of signals between nerve cells.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.840
Another major change in Alzheimer’s disease

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.840
is the formation of twisted fibers

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.384
called neurofibrillary tangles inside the neurons;

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.568
formation of the tangles results in

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.520
death of these nerve cells.
