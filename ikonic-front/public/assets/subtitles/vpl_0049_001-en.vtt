00:00:02.744 --> 00:00:04.608
The goal of stomach stapling

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.600
is to make the stomach smaller.

00:00:07.064 --> 00:00:08.832
You feel full quicker,

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.056
so you eat less,

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.672
which leads to weight loss.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.720
A surgical procedure is performed,

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.560
which involves creating a smaller

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.608
pouch from the larger stomach.

00:00:19.888 --> 00:00:21.752
A vertical double row of staples

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.392
is placed just below where the

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.400
esophagus enters the stomach.

00:00:26.184 --> 00:00:27.840
A plastic band may be added

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.760
to restrict the size of the inlet

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.272
to the rest of the stomach.
