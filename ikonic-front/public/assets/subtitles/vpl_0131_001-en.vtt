00:00:00.472 --> 00:00:02.032
The metacarpals are the

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:03.712
long bones in the hand.

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:05.232
If your child has a fifth

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:06.840
metacarpal fracture,

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.024
also called a boxer’s fracture,

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:10.880
the bone in the hand that attaches

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.728
to the pinky finger has a crack or break.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.528
The most common causes are

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.984
hitting a hard object with a closed fist

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.168
or falling onto the hand.

00:00:20.272 --> 00:00:22.120
If the fracture is at the growth plate

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.632
near the end of the bone,

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.464
bone growth can be affected and

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.592
may require special X-rays or other tests.

00:00:28.784 --> 00:00:31.528
Young bones are more flexible than an adult’s,

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.528
so a child’s bone may crack or

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.512
just buckle without a clear break

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.984
instead of snapping like a dry stick.

00:00:38.104 --> 00:00:40.032
Your child’s healthcare provider will

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.304
straighten the broken bone if it is crooked.

00:00:42.392 --> 00:00:44.256
Your child will then wear a cast

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.888
or splint from the hand to the

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.176
forearm for 4 to 6 weeks.
