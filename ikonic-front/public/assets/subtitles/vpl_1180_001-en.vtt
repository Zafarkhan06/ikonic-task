00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.020
Muscle movement can be broken down into

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.320
concentric and eccentric motion.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.100
Concentric muscle contraction is what usually

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.820
comes to mind when thinking of typical exercise.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.980
It is the standard contraction and lifting motion,

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.700
when the muscle shortens and

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.400
its two connection points come close together.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.400
This movement is acting against

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.220
the force of gravity and improves

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.840
the muscle's ability to pull and lift.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.100
Eccentric contraction is utilizing the same muscle,

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.800
however activates during

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.540
the lowering part of the motion.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.100
As the muscle lengthens,

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.840
the two connection points of the muscle

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.300
get further apart,

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.620
but the muscle continues to contract

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.800
and still exerts force on the weight.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.780
It acts as a sort of braking mechanism,

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.640
slowing down the lowering movement

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.800
and preventing the weight from pulling down

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.120
too quickly with the force of gravity. 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.060
Eccentric training is crucial

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.620
as many of our daily routines

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.460
and habits depend on it.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.980
Rudimentary activities such as sitting down

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.640
or walking down the stairs

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.620
involve such movements.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.640
But rarely do we need just one

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.020
of these types of movements,

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.500
a combination of eccentric and concentric exercises

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.920
is essential in any healthy training program.
