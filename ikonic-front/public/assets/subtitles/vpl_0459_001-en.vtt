00:00:00.968 --> 00:00:02.992
When you take a normal step,

00:00:03.136 --> 00:00:04.520
the first part of your foot

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.480
to touch the ground is your heel.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.216
Your weight is then transferred

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:09.944
to the long bones of the foot,

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.544
or metatarsals.

00:00:11.688 --> 00:00:13.752
The foot rolls from the outside

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.144
inwards, or pronates,

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.856
to distribute the weight across the bones.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:20.280
It starts at the back

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.976
of the outside metatarsal,

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.480
moves to the front of the

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.016
inside metatarsal,

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:26.760
and ends with a push-off

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.984
from the big toe.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.592
Neutral pronation

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.256
means that weight is distributed

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.608
evenly as the foot rolls inwards.

00:00:34.016 --> 00:00:36.480
Some people are overpronators.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.504
This means the foot rolls too far inwards

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.800
as weight is transferred from the heel

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.408
to the metatarsals to the big toe,

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.544
and distributed unevenly with

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.528
too much weight on the big toe.

00:00:48.744 --> 00:00:50.896
Sometimes the arches collapse

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.056
or the ankle rolls inwards.

00:00:53.544 --> 00:00:55.984
People can also be underpronators.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.024
This means the foot does not roll in

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.736
enough as weight moves

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.056
from the heel to the long bones,

00:01:02.368 --> 00:01:03.912
with too much weight being borne

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.624
on the outside of the foot.
