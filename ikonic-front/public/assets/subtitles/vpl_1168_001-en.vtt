00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.400
Bronchitis is a condition affecting

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.820
the bronchial tubes,

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.760
which carry air to and from your lungs.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.780
In bronchitis these tubes are

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.320
inflamed and swollen,

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.520
causing coughing,

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.100
often with mucus, or wheezing.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.780
Bronchitis can be acute or chronic.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.940
Other symptoms of acute bronchitis

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.620
include fever, a mild headache or body aches.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.140
Acute bronchitis

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.960
is typically caused by a virus

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.880
and is usually not serious.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.480
Symptoms typically improve

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.320
within a week to 10 days,

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.660
although the cough may last longer.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.180
Chronic bronchitis

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.300
is a persistent inflammation and

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.380
irritation of the bronchial tubes

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.760
caused by smoking or

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.700
exposure to other irritating substances.
