00:00:03.544 --> 00:00:05.000
The term heartburn

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.728
describes a burning sensation

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.928
in the chest beneath the breastbone.

00:00:09.824 --> 00:00:11.704
It is caused by a backward flow of

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.840
acid-containing stomach contents,

00:00:14.064 --> 00:00:15.400
which irritate and burn the

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.232
tissue lining the esophagus.

00:00:18.112 --> 00:00:19.664
This tube connecting the mouth 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.184
and stomach has a valve

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.080
to prevent this backward flow.

00:00:24.248 --> 00:00:26.776
Heartburn occurs if the valve leaks,

00:00:27.048 --> 00:00:29.688
such as after eating and lying down.

00:00:30.752 --> 00:00:32.264
Other symptoms may include

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:33.872
a sour taste in your mouth,

00:00:34.056 --> 00:00:34.928
burping,

00:00:35.024 --> 00:00:35.920
bloating,

00:00:35.944 --> 00:00:36.816
nausea

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:38.272
and regurgitation.

00:00:38.992 --> 00:00:41.616
Heartburn is common at any age.
