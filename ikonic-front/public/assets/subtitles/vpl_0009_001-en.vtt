00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:04.170
A severe headache that is confined

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.280
to one side of the head and recurs in

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.130
episodes or clusters over weeks or months

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:10.740
is called a cluster headache.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.140
These headaches can be temporarily debilitating.

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:16.620
Cluster headaches are much less common

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.350
than other types of headaches.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.100
They run in families and are more

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.070
common in men than women.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.090
They may be caused by an

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.120
overactive hypothalamus,

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.300
an area in the middle of the brain.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.390
Common triggers for cluster headaches include

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:32.050
alcohol,

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:32.840
stress,

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:33.820
sleep apnea,

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.170
and medications that widen blood vessels,

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.740
such as nitroglycerin or histamines.
