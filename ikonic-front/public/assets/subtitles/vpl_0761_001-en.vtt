00:00:00.368 --> 00:00:03.304
The human heart is a muscle that acts like a pump.

00:00:03.464 --> 00:00:06.760
It contracts and relaxes each time it beats.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.544
The heart has four heart compartments or chambers.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.808
The upper chambers are called atria

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.432
and the lower chambers are called ventricles.

00:00:14.496 --> 00:00:16.104
These chambers fill with blood,

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.472
which is then pumped throughout

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.600
the body to supply nourishment.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.248
The heart has four thin, flexible valves that

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.952
control the flow of blood

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.672
by opening and closing with each heartbeat.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.448
The four valves are the tricuspid valve,

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:30.976
the pulmonic valve,

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.232
the mitral valve,

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.128
and the aortic valve.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.904
The aortic valve is made of

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.992
3 tissue flaps, called leaflets,

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.336
and is located between the left ventricle and the aorta,

00:00:41.368 --> 00:00:42.560
the blood vessel that carries 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.504
blood to the rest of the body.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.144
The aortic valve keeps

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.968
blood moving from the heart into the aorta.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.080
Aortic valve stenosis

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.912
is a narrowing in the opening of

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:54.824
the aortic valve in the heart.

00:00:54.968 --> 00:00:57.016
When the valve opening narrows,

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.360
the valve does not open all the way

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.936
so the heart has to work harder

00:01:00.936 --> 00:01:02.728
to pump blood to the body.
