00:00:00.352 --> 00:00:01.816
An asthma inhaler

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:04.272
delivers a metered dose of medicine

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.544
in a mist that your child inhales

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.760
into the airways of the lungs.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.728
Here are the steps for using

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.792
a metered dose inhaler:

00:00:13.072 --> 00:00:15.280
Remove the caps from the chamber

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.704
and the metered dose inhaler.

00:00:17.984 --> 00:00:20.096
Shake the inhaler vigorously.

00:00:20.352 --> 00:00:22.144
Hold the inhaler upright

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.248
with the mouthpiece at the bottom.

00:00:24.568 --> 00:00:26.664
Insert the mouthpiece of the inhaler

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.360
into the rubber-sealed end of the chamber. 

00:00:29.784 --> 00:00:31.848
Waste 2 puffs in the chamber

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.576
if the inhaler has either never been used,

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.832
or not used for a week or more.

00:00:37.168 --> 00:00:40.056
The wasted puffs donâ€™t count as doses.

00:00:40.656 --> 00:00:42.328
With your child standing

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.760
or sitting up upright,

00:00:43.944 --> 00:00:46.528
place the chamber into the child's mouth.

00:00:47.072 --> 00:00:48.968
Have your child breathe slowly

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.856
in and out of the valved

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.376
holding chamber several times.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.504
While your child is breathing in slowly,

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.688
press the inhaler down once

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.208
to release the medicine into the chamber.

00:01:01.744 --> 00:01:03.656
After youâ€™ve sprayed the medicine,

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.208
have your child breathe in as

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.568
deeply as possible

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.192
and then hold their breath

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:09.872
for 10 seconds.

00:01:10.504 --> 00:01:12.672
Children who cannot hold their breath

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.080
should breathe in and out slowly

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.208
for 3 to 5 breaths.

00:01:17.744 --> 00:01:20.216
If additional puffs have been prescribed,

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.472
wait 1 minute and repeat these steps.
