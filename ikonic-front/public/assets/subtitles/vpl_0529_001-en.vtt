00:00:00.224 --> 00:00:02.016
The average night’s sleep

00:00:02.016 --> 00:00:04.010
of 7-8 hours,

00:00:04.048 --> 00:00:05.984
cycles through different stages

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.352
based on two broad categories,

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.936
called REM, for rapid eye-movement,

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.120
and non-REM sleep.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.256
Most dreams occur during REM sleep;

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.680
there are typically four or five periods

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.664
that get progressively longer during a night’s sleep.

00:00:22.848 --> 00:00:26.056
Non-REM sleep is divided into stages.

00:00:26.208 --> 00:00:28.672
For many years, there were 4 stages,

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.768
but several years ago, 3 and 4

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.904
the deepest stages of sleep

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.960
were merged into a single stage 3.

00:00:37.176 --> 00:00:38.512
Throughout the night,

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.384
a person cycles through light

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.936
to deep stages of non-REM sleep,

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.968
interspersed by cycles of REM sleep.
