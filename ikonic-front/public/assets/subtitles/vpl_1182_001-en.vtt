00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.800
A panic attack is a sudden feeling of intense fear

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.200
and anxiety that triggers severe physical reactions

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.120
when there is no real danger or apparent cause.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.680
Panic attacks can be very frightening.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:19.960
During a panic attack,

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.200
you might think you're losing control,

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.380
having a heart attack or even dying.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.860
Some symptoms are:

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.500
Rapid, pounding heart

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.700
trouble breathing

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.820
chest pain

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:31.840
sweating

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.040
feeling tingly or light-headed

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.500
tunnel or blurred vision

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.600
people also feel terror,

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.720
like something really awful is about to happen

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.800
Most panic attacks last somewhere

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.640
from five minutes to half an hour.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.040
And although panic attacks themselves aren't life-threatening,

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.400
they can significantly affect your quality of life.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.560
Sometimes the fear of it happening again can be so great

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.020
that a person will change the things they do,

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.120
and the way they interact with others

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.920
or even how much they go to work or school.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.980
This is what’s known as panic disorder.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.500
Sometimes this becomes so serious that

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.920
people stop leaving their home to avoid places

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.800
and situations that an attack might happen.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.720
This is called agoraphobia.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.840
Panic attacks don’t have to control your life.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.080
You can take control back.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.280
Deep breathing exercises and therapy

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.620
can help you know what to do if one starts

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.380
and to learn to control the fear of future attacks.
