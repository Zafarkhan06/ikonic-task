00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.064
There are four heart compartments, or chambers. 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.136
The upper two are the atria,

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.584
and the lower two are the ventricles.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.232
Blood comes into the chambers and is then pumped

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.000
to the rest of the body to supply nourishment.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.224
The flow of blood inside the heart

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:18.264
is controlled by four thin, flexible valves

00:00:18.288 --> 00:00:20.888
that open and close with each heartbeat.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.944
They are the tricuspid valve,

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.408
the pulmonic valve,

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.744
the mitral valve,

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.432
and the aortic valve.

00:00:27.992 --> 00:00:30.112
The aortic valve is composed of

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.560
3 tissue flaps, called leaflets.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.784
It is located between the left ventricle

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:35.864
and the aorta,

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.984
the blood vessel that carries blood to the rest of the body.

00:00:39.264 --> 00:00:41.728
The aortic valve opens to move blood

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.544
from the heart into the aorta

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.344
and normally closes tightly between each heartbeat,

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.008
to keep the blood from flowing back into the heart.
