Warts are common growths seen on the skin.

00:00:03.888 --> 00:00:06.200
They usually grow on the hands or feet,

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.368
but can occur anywhere on the body.

00:00:08.584 --> 00:00:11.360
Warts are caused by a papilloma virus

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.872
and are contagious.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.928
The virus enters through breaks in the skin

00:00:16.128 --> 00:00:18.000
and buries itself in the layer

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.632
filled with blood vessels.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.808
Once established in the skin,

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.648
the virus enters the cells

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.072
and hijacks their internal machinery,

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.968
forcing the normal cells

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.216
to produce more virus particles.

00:00:30.448 --> 00:00:32.472
The virus causes the skin cells

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.416
to multiply forming the wart clump.
