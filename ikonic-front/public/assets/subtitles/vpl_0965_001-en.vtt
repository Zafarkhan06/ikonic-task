00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
Calcium channel blockers slow the movement of calcium between cells.

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.020
This helps the body improve blood flow and control heart rhythm.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.580
Calcium helps the heart to pump and blood vessels change size.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.120
However, too much calcium can cause the heart to be out of rhythm,

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.460
and make blood vessels narrower.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.660
As blood vessels narrow, less blood travels to the heart

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.100
and it receives less oxygen.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.940
This causes the heart to pump harder to get the oxygen it needs.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.260
By getting in calcium's way,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.320
and slowing calcium flow between cells,

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.860
calcium channel blockers restore normal heart beat

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.120
as well as normal blood and oxygen flow throughout the body.
