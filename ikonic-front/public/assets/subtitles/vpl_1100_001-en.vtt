00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.140
A total hip replacement is a surgical procedure

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.440
that replaces damaged cartilage and bone

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.280
in your hip with artificial components. 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.140
Some hip replacements require

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.600
a large incision on the back of the hip.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.000
This approach requires muscles to be cut

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.580
in order for your surgeon to see

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.140
the bones of your hip joint.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.180
A direct anterior hip replacement

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.820
is a muscle sparing surgical technique.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.320
A direct anterior approach uses a small

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.740
incision on the front of your hip.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.040
With this approach, muscles are not cut.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.800
Instead two muscles at the front of your hip

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.820
are slid apart at a natural separation point.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.200
A smaller incision and less damage

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.300
to muscles and soft tissues around the hip

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.640
may result in less pain after surgery

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.020
and a faster recovery

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.940
compared to traditional hip replacement surgery. 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.160
To begin a direct anterior approach for hip replacement,

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.000
your surgeon makes an incision in the front of your hip

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.640
and separates two muscles to gain access to your hip joint.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.800
With the hip joint now exposed,

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.120
the ball portion at the top of your femur,

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.080
or thighbone, is removed.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.380
A tool called a reamer

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:07.680
is used to prepare the acetabulum,

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.400
or socket, to accept the acetabular portion

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.800
of the hip replacement.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.840
This component includes a metal shell

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.260
and a plastic liner.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.000
A femoral stem is implanted in your thighbone.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.760
The ball, or femoral head,

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.760
is attached to the stem.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.720
The new ball portion of the thighbone

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.600
is inserted into the socket part of the hip. 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.900
Before closing, the surgeon will move

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.520
the new hip implant to ensure

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.400
that it is functioning properly.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.540
The artificial components are designed to

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.800
reproduce the mobility of the natural hip joint.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.640
Talk with your surgeon about the

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.180
best approach and implant for you.
