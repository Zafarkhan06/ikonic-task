00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.752
Your digestive tract

00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:02.944
is made up of different

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:04.264
organs and segments,

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:05.688
which develop from what is called

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.016
the “primitive gut” in an embryo.

00:00:08.392 --> 00:00:10.448
The top part or foregut

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.400
develops into the esophagus,

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.120
stomach, and duodenum,

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.608
which is the first part of the small intestine.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.680
The middle part or midgut

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:19.664
develops into your

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.248
jejunum and ileum,

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.768
the middle and lower parts

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.232
of your small intestine.

00:00:24.496 --> 00:00:26.520
The bottom section or hindgut

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.352
develops into your colon.

00:00:28.712 --> 00:00:31.008
As seen from the anterior or front,

00:00:31.072 --> 00:00:32.896
the colon goes upwards from the

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.072
small intestine as

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.688
the ascending colon,

00:00:35.776 --> 00:00:37.480
crosses the abdomen and is

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.664
attached to your stomach

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.608
as the transverse colon,

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.464
and then goes down to the rectum

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.336
as the descending colon.

00:00:44.456 --> 00:00:45.952
It is supplied with blood

00:00:45.952 --> 00:00:47.760
by the mesenteric artery.
