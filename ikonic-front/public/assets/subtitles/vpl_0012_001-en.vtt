00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.400
Digestion is the process of breaking food down

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.440
so that nutrients can be absorbed by cells.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:07.730
In your stomach,

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.240
food is churned and mixed with acid and enzymes.

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.840
It is then pushed into the first part of the small intestine,

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.270
where most digestion and absorption takes place.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:19.970
To aid absorption,

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.420
it is mixed with bile,

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.080
which is produced by the liver

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.920
and discharged from the gallbladder through ducts.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.120
Digested food molecules

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.290
pass into blood vessels in the walls of the intestine

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.820
and are carried up through the portal vein

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.080
into the liver for further processing and storage.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.220
The liver is usually a rich, red color,

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.760
but excess lipids stored in its cells

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.930
can change it to a whitish color.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.110
This is known as fatty liver disease.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.900
It is closely associated with obesity,

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.380
particularly central obesity

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.040
involving the omentum,

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.920
a fatty pad that hangs down from the stomach.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.720
Eating too much fat

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.450
can cause it to push out,

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.790
producing a large waist line.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.510
In some people, eating certain foods can

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.120
irritate the walls of the small intestine

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.230
and disrupt regular movement,

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.420
resulting in altered bowel habits,

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:14.950
or irritable bowel.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.840
Almost all nutrients have been absorbed by the time

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.400
digested food leaves the small intestine

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.870
and enters the colon,

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.290
where water and salt are extracted

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.170
leaving solid wastes for elimination.
