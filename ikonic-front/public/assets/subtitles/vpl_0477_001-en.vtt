00:00:00.472 --> 00:00:02.880
Your kidneys are bean-shaped organs

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.936
located in the middle of your back,

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:07.208
on either side of your spine.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.488
They process blood to sift out

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.480
waste products and extra water,

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.080
which becomes urine.

00:00:13.488 --> 00:00:15.424
Kidney stones are formed mostly

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.040
from deposits of calcium

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.080
in the outer layer or cortex of the kidney.

00:00:20.376 --> 00:00:23.096
Inside the kidneyâ€™s basic filtering unit,

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.752
called the glomerulus,

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.480
stones are slowly built up

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.856
from the joining of calcium-containing molecules.

00:00:30.104 --> 00:00:32.496
This build-up can turn into a stone,

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.296
called a renal calculus,

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.744
which can eventually clog the ureter

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.352
the tube leading down from the

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:39.848
kidney to the bladder.

00:00:40.144 --> 00:00:42.016
Once this tube is blocked,

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.824
it can become difficult for urine

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.640
to pass out of the body.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.896
If the flow of urine is blocked,

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.384
pressure can build

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.496
and cause pain that begins suddenly

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.432
in the back or abdomen.

00:00:53.592 --> 00:00:56.688
As it moves down this very sensitive tube,

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.224
the renal calculus can be

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.384
the source of extreme pain.
