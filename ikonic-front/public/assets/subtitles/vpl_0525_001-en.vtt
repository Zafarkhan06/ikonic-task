00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.768
Burns are a very common injury.

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.104
The least serious,

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.920
called first degree burns,

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.936
involve only the outer layers

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:09.648
of skin or epidermis,

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.808
which usually turns red.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.544
Second degree burns

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.456
penetrate both the epidermis

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.056
and the next layer, called the dermis.

00:00:18.112 --> 00:00:20.232
Blisters form when watery liquid

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.208
leaks from damaged tissues and blood vessels.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.448
The affected area is painful

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.256
and has blistery, red marks that

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.288
can swell or ooze.

00:00:29.616 --> 00:00:32.504
Third degree burns are the most severe. 

00:00:32.552 --> 00:00:35.152
They penetrate through all layers of the skin

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.752
and can involve fat, muscle, or even bone.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.792
These burns are an emergency

00:00:40.792 --> 00:00:42.576
and require medical help.
