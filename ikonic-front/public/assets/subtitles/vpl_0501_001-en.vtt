00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.736
Your heart pumps blood through arteries

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.784
to deliver oxygen and nutrients

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:06.256
throughout your body.

00:00:06.384 --> 00:00:09.200
The blood returns to your heart through veins

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.080
so that it can be pumped to the lungs

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.952
to pick up more oxygen.

00:00:13.016 --> 00:00:15.096
When blood is in leg veins,

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.000
it is working against gravity

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.648
to return to the heart.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.184
Blood pressure in veins is low,

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.288
so there are valves in the walls of the

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.512
veins to prevent the blood from flowing backward.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.776
Leg muscles contract to squeeze the veins

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.752
and help pump your blood back to the heart.

00:00:32.936 --> 00:00:36.464
Some peopleâ€™s legs have large, ropey veins.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.240
Called varicose veins,

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.400
they are large because

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.400
they are always expanded.

00:00:41.656 --> 00:00:43.696
The blood in these veins is having a hard

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.456
time returning to the heart,

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.104
and pressure from above

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.560
the force of gravity

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.128
on the column of blood

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.416
forces the thin walls of the veins

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.664
to push outward, making the veins bigger.

00:00:56.008 --> 00:00:57.920
An enlarged varicose vein

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.488
contains more blood,

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.640
and this also puts pressure on the

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.088
valves in the veins,

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.976
which can cause them to fail.

00:01:05.264 --> 00:01:07.496
Changes during pregnancy can promote

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.968
the development of varicose veins.

00:01:10.088 --> 00:01:12.104
The pregnancy puts more pressure

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.592
on the veins in your legs and pelvis.

00:01:14.752 --> 00:01:16.824
To support the developing baby,

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.576
the volume of blood in your body

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.632
is increased but blood flow

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.360
from your legs to your pelvis is reduced.

00:01:23.472 --> 00:01:26.056
Hormonal changes can also contribute

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.048
and increase the elasticity of

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.736
blood vessel walls.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.600
When varicose veins

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.256
occur during pregnancy,

00:01:33.272 --> 00:01:35.224
they often resolve on their own

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.224
during the months after delivery.
