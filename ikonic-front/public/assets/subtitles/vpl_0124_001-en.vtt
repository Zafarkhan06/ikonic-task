Influenza, also known as the flu,

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:04.912
is a respiratory infection

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:06.536
caused by a virus.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.424
The virus spreads through close

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:09.808
contact with someone who is

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.144
sneezing or coughing

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.080
or by handling objects that were touched

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.872
by someone with the flu.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.680
Compared to a cold,

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.808
flu symptoms develop much faster

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.136
and are more severe.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.872
They can last from 3 days

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:23.136

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:32.928
sore throat

00:00:33.368 --> 00:00:34.880
Your healthcare provider can

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.664
prescribe medications to reduce

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.264
the severity of flu symptoms,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.952
if taken right away.

00:00:40.632 --> 00:00:42.408
You can reduce your chances of

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.464
getting the flu

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.672
by staying away from

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:45.968
people who are sick;

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.848
washing your hands frequently,

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.304
especially before touching your

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.968
eyes, nose, or mouth;

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:51.896
and getting a flu

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.728
