00:00:01.816 --> 00:00:04.344
Your pancreas is a long, slender organ

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.768
that lies behind the stomach and intestines,

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:07.976
near the spine.

00:00:08.904 --> 00:00:10.816
This delicate but vital gland

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:12.896
is responsible for regulating your bodies

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:15.728
blood sugar with hormones such as insulin,

00:00:17.016 --> 00:00:21.072
and for helping breakdown food with digestive enzymes.

00:00:23.304 --> 00:00:26.080
The pancreas is divided into four parts:

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.072
the head,

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.184
the neck,

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.168
the body,

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.320
and the tail.

00:00:32.368 --> 00:00:35.240
When cancer develops throughout the pancreas

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.360
the entire organ needs to be removed,

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.952
in a procedure known as a total pancreatectomy.

00:00:41.424 --> 00:00:44.056
Before beginning a total pancreatectomy

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.968
a patient is put under general anesthesia.

00:00:47.512 --> 00:00:48.760
Your surgeon will then make

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.136
one or more incisions in the abdomen.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.440
Depending upon the preferred approach.

00:00:53.968 --> 00:00:55.336
Subcostal,

00:00:55.848 --> 00:00:56.920
midline,

00:00:57.024 --> 00:00:59.288
or through several small incisions,

00:00:59.456 --> 00:01:03.808
known as a laparoscopic or robot-assisted approach.

00:01:04.264 --> 00:01:07.400
Your surgeon will remove the entire pancreas,

00:01:07.536 --> 00:01:10.760
a small segment of the intestine and the spleen,

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.472
along with the gall bladder and the common bile duct.

00:01:14.904 --> 00:01:16.470
The lower end of the stomach,

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.064
known as the pylorus,

00:01:18.128 --> 00:01:21.824
and nearby lymph nodes may also require removal.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.312
The pylorus is a valve that controls the flow of

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.136
food from the stomach to the intestines.

00:01:28.384 --> 00:01:31.376
This structure may be preserved whenever possible.

00:01:31.744 --> 00:01:34.240
Especially large tumors may encroach

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.240
upon nearby blood vessels

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.856
that supply or drain the intestines.

00:01:39.168 --> 00:01:41.312
Reconstruction of the veins and arteries

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.536
involved is technically challenging,

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.648
and is evaluated and performed

00:01:45.648 --> 00:01:47.640
on a case by case basis.

00:01:48.352 --> 00:01:50.472
Once the cancer has been removed,

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:51.584
your surgeon will begin 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.112
reconstructing the digestive tract.

00:01:54.616 --> 00:01:56.520
A loop of the small intestine will be

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.600
connected directly to the common hepatic duct

00:02:00.736 --> 00:02:02.080
and the stomach.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.416
A total pancreatectomy,

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.024
is usually very successful at eliminating

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.072
cancer that has spread through the entire pancreas.

00:02:12.216 --> 00:02:13.792
It is a major operation,

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.840
that usually takes 6-8 hours.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.248
Most patients are fully recovered and back

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.352
to daily routines within a couple of weeks.
