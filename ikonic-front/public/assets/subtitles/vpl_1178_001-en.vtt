00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.460
Depression is a serious and common medical condition

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.700
that affects how you feel, your mood,

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.640
how you think and act.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.500
Also called clinical depression

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.360
or major depressive disorder,

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.880
depression can lead to a variety of emotional

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.120
and physical problems and can affect

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.300
your ability to handle daily activities,

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.180
such as sleeping, eating, or working.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.340
Feeling down at times is a normal part of life.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.140
Sad and difficult events happen to everyone.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.240
But if you’re experiencing symptoms on a regular basis,

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.660
you may be dealing with depression.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.760
To be diagnosed with depression, 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.220
symptoms must be present most of the time

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.320
for at least 2 weeks.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.700
Common symptoms are:

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.360
Feeling sad, “empty”, or a depressed mood

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.540
Feeling hopeless, worthless, or guilty

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.140
Loss of interest in activities you previously enjoyed

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.340
Feeling bothered, annoyed, or angry

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.440
Trouble sleeping or sleeping too much

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.540
Loss of energy or increased fatigue

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.920
Difficulty concentrating, remembering,

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.740
or making decisions

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.540
Moving or talking more slowly

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.760
Thoughts of death, suicide, 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.740
self-harm, or suicide attempts

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.380
Treatment is available for depression.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.620
Talk with your healthcare provider right away

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.620
if you are experiencing symptoms of depression. 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.040
Depression is a complex disease and

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.620
researchers are constantly learning more.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.860
Use of new brain imaging technology

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.960
has led to a better understanding of

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.440
which areas of the brain regulate mood.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.920
Areas of the brain that play

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.580
a significant role in depression

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:38.660
are the amygdala,

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:39.920
the thalamus, and

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.280
the hippocampus.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.640
Depression is not as simple as

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.600
one brain chemical being too low

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.500
and another being too high.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.640
More important than levels of specific brain chemicals,

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.780
researchers believe that nerve cell growth and connections,

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.440
and the functioning of nerve circuits in the brain

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.900
have a major impact on depression.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.960
Researchers understanding of the biology of depression

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.400
is far from complete

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.980
and advancements continue to be made.
