00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.580
Erectile dysfunction agents work by increasing blood flow

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.420
in arteries that support smooth muscle.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.440
As a result of sexual stimulation,

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.580
the body releases a substance that directs proteins to relax blood vessels.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.980
Relaxation of the vessels in the Corpora Cavernosa

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.600
improves blood flow and causes the tissue to swell.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.180
Relaxed blood vessels with increased blood flow

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.380
allow the penis to stay erect during sexual stimulation.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.800
When sexual stimulation stops,

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.100
the body uses an enzyme,

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.360
phosphodiesterase or PDE,

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.160
to reduce swelling by breaking down the proteins.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.640
This helps to relax smooth muscle

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.140
and restore normal blood flow.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.280
One group of erectile dysfunction agents

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.260
is PDE-5 inhibitors.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.040
PDE-5 inhibitors work by stopping protein breakdown.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.140
Relief from the protein breakdown helps maintain muscle stimulation

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.620
which can result in a longer lasting erection.
