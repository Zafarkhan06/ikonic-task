00:09.972 --> 00:14.189
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that get their name

00:14.189 --> 00:17.663
from the halo of spiked proteins on their outer surface,

00:17.663 --> 00:21.365
which resemble a crown, the “corona”, under a microscope.

00:21.365 --> 00:25.502
The new coronavirus is called SARS-CoV-2.

00:25.502 --> 00:31.489
SARS-CoV-2 stands for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

00:31.489 --> 00:34.641
As a new virus, it means that previously

00:34.641 --> 00:37.114
no one in the world has been infected with it

00:37.114 --> 00:40.651
and, therefore, no one has antibodies to it.

00:40.651 --> 00:43.434
Because no one has antibodies,

00:43.434 --> 00:45.401
everyone is at risk for catching the virus,

00:45.401 --> 00:48.852
becoming ill, and spreading the virus.

00:48.852 --> 00:51.497
With the discovery of SARS-CoV-2,

00:51.497 --> 00:56.213
there are now seven types of coronaviruses known to affect humans.

00:56.213 --> 00:58.695
Four regularly circulate in humans

00:58.695 --> 01:02.429
and mostly cause mild to moderate upper-respiratory tract symptoms

01:02.429 --> 01:05.653
that most people think of as the common cold.

01:05.653 --> 01:09.965
SARS-CoV-2 causes a disease called COVID-19,

01:09.965 --> 01:12.138
a severe respiratory illness.

01:12.138 --> 01:14.378
COVID-19 can be deadly,

01:14.378 --> 01:16.283
particularly for older people

01:16.283 --> 01:18.950
and those with underlying health conditions.

01:18.950 --> 01:21.690
The virus is spread through droplets in the air

01:21.690 --> 01:23.682
after coughing or sneezing,

01:23.682 --> 01:27.566
which people nearby can take in through their nose, mouth or eyes.

01:27.566 --> 01:31.792
The virus can also spread by touching a contaminated surface,

01:31.792 --> 01:35.178
but it’s unclear how long the virus lives on surfaces.

01:35.178 --> 01:37.277
Once inside your body,

01:37.277 --> 01:40.433
the virus travels quickly to the back of your nasal passages

01:40.433 --> 01:43.823
and to the mucous membranes in the back of your throat.

01:43.823 --> 01:46.801
The virus attaches to a receptor called

01:46.801 --> 01:50.875
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, or ACE2,

01:50.875 --> 01:53.492
on respiratory cells in your body.

01:53.492 --> 01:56.984
The virus’s genetic material enters your cells.

01:56.984 --> 01:59.784
The virus then “hijacks” your cells to produce

01:59.784 --> 02:03.892
copies of itself which go on to infect more cells.

02:03.892 --> 02:06.278
The time between the initial infection and the

02:06.278 --> 02:11.561
first symptoms appearing varies widely but is five days on average.

02:11.561 --> 02:14.548
Symptoms often start in the back of the throat,

02:14.548 --> 02:18.024
with a dry cough and sore throat, along with a fever. 

02:18.024 --> 02:20.801
Symptoms become more severe as the infection starts

02:20.801 --> 02:23.905
making its way to your lower respiratory tract.

02:23.905 --> 02:26.777
Here, it can cause more respiratory problems

02:26.777 --> 02:29.005
like bronchitis and pneumonia.

02:29.005 --> 02:31.061
When the virus reaches your lungs,

02:31.061 --> 02:34.301
it causes inflammation in the air sacs in your lungs,

02:34.301 --> 02:36.377
which are called alveoli.

02:36.377 --> 02:41.658
Your alveoli are where oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged.

02:41.658 --> 02:45.070
In pneumonia there is swelling, decreased airflow,

02:45.070 --> 02:48.026
and your alveoli start to fill with fluid,

02:48.026 --> 02:51.162
causing shortness of breath and difficulty breathing.

02:51.162 --> 02:54.334
Some people need a ventilator to help them breathe.

02:54.334 --> 02:57.936
Less oxygen in your blood deprives other major organs

02:57.936 --> 03:01.948
of oxygen including your liver, kidney and brain.

03:01.948 --> 03:03.742
Acute respiratory distress,

03:03.742 --> 03:06.217
caused by widespread swelling in the lungs,

03:06.217 --> 03:10.209
stops your body from getting the oxygen it needs to survive.

03:10.209 --> 03:14.361
This respiratory distress can lead to organ failure and death.

03:14.361 --> 03:17.157
While COVID-19 can be deadly,

03:17.157 --> 03:20.673
the vast majority, around 80 percent, of cases

03:20.673 --> 03:22.969
are mild to moderate, and

03:22.969 --> 03:25.325
people recover within a week or two.
