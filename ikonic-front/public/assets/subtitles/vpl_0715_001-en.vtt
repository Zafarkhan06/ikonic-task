00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.208
Once called the Royal Disease,

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.680
hemophilia is an inherited bleeding disorder.

00:00:05.808 --> 00:00:07.928
Those who have it lack a protein,

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.560
called a clotting factor,

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.880
which is required for blood to clot.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.216
Your body has several clotting factors

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.248
which are all necessary for proper blood clotting.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.168
When you cut your skin or a blood vessel

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.464
a series of reactions occur

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.472
to activate clotting factors and platelets.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.272
This creates a kind of glue

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.120
that forms a clot that acts like a plug.

00:00:30.304 --> 00:00:32.568
When a clotting factor is missing,

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.904
the chain reaction is disrupted,

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.784
so it takes longer for bleeding to stop.

00:00:38.008 --> 00:00:40.376
This means a person bleeds longer

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.536
after an injury and sometimes

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.008
bleeds without an obvious cause.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.032
Over time, internal bleeding

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.432
can damage tissues and organs.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.768
About 70-80% of bleeding incidents

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.992
involve the joints and can cause

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.408
damage similar to arthritis.

00:00:57.648 --> 00:00:59.624
The first treatments for hemophilia

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.728
involved transfusions of the missing

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.416
factor from donor blood.

00:01:03.704 --> 00:01:06.808
In the 1980s, many of those treated

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.408
became infected with HIV and hepatitis.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.384
Fortunately, that risk has been virtually eliminated

00:01:14.392 --> 00:01:17.536
by new screening procedures and technologies.

00:01:17.624 --> 00:01:19.592
Scientists have also figured out

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.216
how to create synthetic blood factors

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:23.928
by cloning natural genes

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.000
responsible for their production.

00:01:26.376 --> 00:01:28.472
And there are ongoing efforts

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.280
to remove all human and animal proteins

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.336
from treatments for hemophilia.
