00:00:00.312 --> 00:00:04.112
Why we yawn is not completely understood.

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:05.912
But it is generally agreed

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.456
that is an involuntary respiratory reflex.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.808
This means that without deciding to do so,

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.728
you open your mouth and your tongue moves back

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.656
so you can take in as much air as possible.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.656
Then you take a long, deep breath.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.624
Your diaphragm moves down

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.040
as your lungs begin to fill with air.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.328
Muscles between the ribs pull them up and out,

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.416
which creates a larger space in the chest cavity.

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.016
The lungs are filled to capacity,

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.272
and then you slowly exhale,

00:00:37.328 --> 00:00:39.648
blowing some of the air back out.
