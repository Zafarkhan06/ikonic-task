00:00:00.576 --> 00:00:04.072
The medical term for teeth grinding is bruxism.

00:00:04.168 --> 00:00:06.448
It refers to unconscious clenching

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.360
or grinding of the teeth.

00:00:08.592 --> 00:00:10.808
Tooth grinding is based on repetitive,

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.176
unconscious movement of the masseter,

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.320
temporalis, and other muscles of mastication

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.440
the primary chewing muscles.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.056
These are extremely strong muscles;

00:00:21.096 --> 00:00:22.720
people can commonly generate

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.328
150 pounds of pressure between their teeth.

00:00:26.616 --> 00:00:29.080
Many people grind their teeth at night.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.552
Over time, the pressure and grinding motion

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.976
wear down the teeth

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.704
and cause them to crack and break down.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.680
Tooth grinding also commonly causes headaches,

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.144
jaw pain, and other problems.

00:00:42.712 --> 00:00:44.376
Many people are unaware

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.840
that they grind their teeth,

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.448
and the problem is identified

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.960
only because of pain,

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.024
dental problems, or when someone

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.312
hears them grinding their teeth at night.

00:00:53.672 --> 00:00:56.576
The causes are not completely understood;

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.416
among the possible reasons are stress

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:00.840
and upper and lower teeth

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.016
that are not properly aligned.

00:01:03.512 --> 00:01:05.840
Treatment is not always needed;

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.816
serious problems may be treated with medications,

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.936
dental approaches such as mouth guards,

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.544
and other techniques.
