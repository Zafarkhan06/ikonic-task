00:00:00.384 --> 00:00:02.936
Angina is chest pain that occurs

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:04.392
when the heart muscle is not

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.416
getting enough oxygen.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.736
It is commonly described as a crushing

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.424
or squeezing pain in the chest.

00:00:11.768 --> 00:00:14.240
Oxygen is carried by red blood cells

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.848
and delivered to the heart muscle

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.040
via the coronary arteries.

00:00:18.288 --> 00:00:20.704
Over the years, the insides of the

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.952
coronary arteries can narrow.

00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:26.368
The most common cause is a build-up of plaque.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.536
As the insides of the arteries

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.600
become narrow, blood flow is reduced,

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.328
and your heart has to work harder

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.728
to get the oxygen it needs.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.992
People with a condition called stable angina

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.040
experience chest pain with physical exertion,

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.600
when the heart needs more oxygen.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.104
Besides the chest,

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.296
there may also be pain in the arms,

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.512
neck, shoulders, and back.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.640
The pain goes away when the exertion stops.

00:00:53.744 --> 00:00:56.888
Sometimes plaque that has built up breaks apart,

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.360
or a blood clot forms,

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.520
and blood flow to the heart is suddenly

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.520
and severely reduced.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.128
The pain does not go away with rest

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.440
or the medications that relieve stable angina.

00:01:08.576 --> 00:01:12.288
This condition is called unstable angina.

00:01:12.488 --> 00:01:14.280
It is a medical emergency

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.008
because without blood-carrying oxygen,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.152
the heart muscle dies.

00:01:19.272 --> 00:01:20.912
This death of heart muscle

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.512
due to lack of oxygen

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.168
is what we commonly call

00:01:24.168 --> 00:01:26.160
a heart attack.
