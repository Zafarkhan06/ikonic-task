00:00:00.152 --> 00:00:02.288
Malabsorption means your body is

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.832
not absorbing nutrients

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:05.128
from the foods you eat.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.640
One organ that can play an

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.792
important role is your pancreas.

00:00:09.248 --> 00:00:11.952
This organ lies partly behind your stomach

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.424
and partly in the curve of the duodenum

00:00:14.584 --> 00:00:16.736
the first part of the small intestine,

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.208
where food enters after leaving your stomach.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.104
The pancreas produces fluid

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.456
that helps with digestion

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:23.880
in the small intestine.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.824
The fluid collects and flows in ducts

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.064
that run the length of the pancreas.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.240
Just before entering the duodenum,

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.768
the pancreatic ducts

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.368
join up with the common bile duct.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.384
Bile, another fluid that helps with digestion

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.112
comes from the liver and gallbladder.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.304
If these ducts become blocked

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.336
so that bile and pancreatic fluid

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.472
canâ€™t flow into the duodenum,

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.640
digestion of foods will be affected

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.288
and certain nutrients may not be absorbed.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.304
A tumor at the head of the pancreas

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.424
around the ducts is one possible cause.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.584
Bile, which flows from the gallbladder and liver,

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.912
can back up and spill into the bloodstream.

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.264
This can cause jaundice, or yellowing,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.464
of tissues, especially the eyes.
