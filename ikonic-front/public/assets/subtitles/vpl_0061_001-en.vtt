00:00:00.568 --> 00:00:03.072
One of the exciting parts of pregnancy

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:04.704
is understanding how your baby

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.408
is developing and growing.

00:00:06.536 --> 00:00:08.288
A spinal cord develops about

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.640
two weeks after sperm

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.024
fertilizes an egg.

00:00:11.192 --> 00:00:13.096
The baby’s head and body develop

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.256
after six weeks of pregnancy.

00:00:15.368 --> 00:00:17.968
The heart, eyes, brain, mouth,

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.080
inner ears, and digestive system

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.440
begin to form.

00:00:21.592 --> 00:00:23.048
There are tiny buds that will

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.000
become arms and legs.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.568
During the second month,

00:00:26.568 --> 00:00:28.560
development is very rapid

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.216
as all of your baby’s major

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.144
body organs and body systems,

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.752
including the lungs, liver

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.792
and stomach start to develop.

00:00:35.992 --> 00:00:38.016
The ears and eyelids form.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.128
Ankles, toes, wrists,

00:00:40.152 --> 00:00:42.640
fingers, and sexual organs develop.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.472
At the end of the second month

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:45.728
your baby looks like a

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.408
miniature human infant

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.216
a little over an inch long,

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.976
or three centimeters long,

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.888
and weighing less than one ounce

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.752
or 28 grams.
