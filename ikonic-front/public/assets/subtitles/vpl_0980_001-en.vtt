00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.300
Corticosteroids provide anti-inflammatory relief for many conditions

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:10.360
and come in drug forms such as tablets, inhalers, eyedrops and others.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.040
The body normally responds to inflammation or cell damage

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.240
by producing white blood cells and chemical messengers

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.220
to fight an infection or repair damage.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.620
However, in some cases the surge of all of these

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.480
substances to a localized area of the body

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.820
can cause symptoms of inflammation

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.400
and damage to the body's tissues.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.120
Corticosteroids bind to steroid receptors inside cells

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.660
and form a tightly formed group.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.880
When the steroid receptor group is activated,

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.380
it moves inside the cell's nucleus,

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.260
where it is able to control the cell's ability to make proteins.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.380
The proteins that are made decrease

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.480
inflammatory chemical messengers

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.740
and reduce symptoms of inflammation

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.480
like swelling, redness, pain and others.
