00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.400
Many different viruses can

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.416
cause influenza, or flu,

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:05.688
a contagious illness

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.408
of the respiratory tract.

00:00:07.528 --> 00:00:09.312
Flu is spread through the air

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:10.600
when an infected person

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.000
coughs or sneezes,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.240
or by touching things

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.648
infected with the virus

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:15.944
and then touching your mouth

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.096
or nose.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:18.928
An infected person can spread

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.488
the virus before symptoms develop.

00:00:21.984 --> 00:00:24.248
Typical symptoms of influenza:

00:00:24.432 --> 00:00:27.512
Fever (100 to 103 degrees

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.872
Fahrenheit in adults;

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:30.600
may be higher in children)

00:00:31.072 --> 00:00:32.872
Respiratory symptoms such as

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:33.512
Cough

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.584
Sore throat

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.624
Runny or stuffy nose

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.152
Muscle aches

00:00:38.328 --> 00:00:40.832
Fatigue, sometimes extreme

00:00:41.712 --> 00:00:43.552
Like all other viruses,

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.704
influenza cannot be controlled with

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.592
antibiotics like penicillin,

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.176
which kills bacteria.

00:00:49.488 --> 00:00:52.256
Flu shots are reformulated each year

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.912
based on the type of virus

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.272
expected to be most common.

00:00:56.688 --> 00:00:58.624
The vaccine offers some protection

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.248
once antibodies develop,

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.920
approximately 2 weeks after the shot.
