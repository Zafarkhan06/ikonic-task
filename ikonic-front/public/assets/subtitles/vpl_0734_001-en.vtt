00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.392
After a meal, your body absorbs

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:05.008
essential nutrients and substances. 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.304
As part of the digestion process,

00:00:07.376 --> 00:00:09.300
the small intestine separates 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.000
cholesterol from food

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.512
and transports it through the

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.408
lymphatic system and into the bloodstream.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.736
Once these particles reach the liver,

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.144
they are modified into processed forms

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.256
of cholesterol known as HDL and LDL.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.776
Your liver produces about three-quarters

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:28.560
of the cholesterol in your body.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.016
The remainder comes from what you eat.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.680
HDL, often referred to as “good cholesterol,”

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.536
lowers the risk of heart and cardiovascular problems.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.560
LDL, known as “bad cholesterol,”

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.920
significantly raises the risk of health problems,

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.336
including atherosclerosis and heart disease.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.776
LDL causes plaque to build up

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.304
in artery walls and restricts blood flow.

00:00:56.112 --> 00:00:58.408
When you eat high fiber foods such as

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.632
oatmeal, beans and vegetables,

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.032
your HDL level rises.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.464
The fiber holds water as it passes

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.280
through the digestive tract.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.880
These particles slow digestion

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.696
and block your body’s ability to absorb cholesterol.

00:01:14.296 --> 00:01:16.976
As a result, the cholesterol passes

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.664
through your digestive tract

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.112
and your body eliminates it along with other waste.

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.896
A high fiber diet is part of a healthy lifestyle.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.416
It significantly reduces bad cholesterol.
