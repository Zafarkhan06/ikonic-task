00:00:00.288 --> 00:00:02.696
Osteoporosis is a common problem that

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:05.616
can lead to broken bones as women age.

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:07.112
To reduce this risk,

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.312
millions of women take calcium supplements.

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:12.704
After being broken down in the stomach,

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.448
the calcium is absorbed in the small intestine

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.368
and transported through the bloodstream

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.560
to bones and other tissues.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.432
99% of the calcium in your body

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.600
is stored in your bones and teeth,

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.952
and calcium supports their structure and function.

00:00:28.104 --> 00:00:30.432
To prevent loss of bone mass,

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.488
it’s important to have enough calcium

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.120
in the blood transported to bones.

00:00:35.272 --> 00:00:37.856
There is concern that this goal may be hindered

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.368
by long-term or chronic use of the drugs

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.240
called proton pump inhibitors—or PPIs.

00:00:44.368 --> 00:00:46.472
PPIs shut down the pumps

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.256
in stomach cells that make stomach acid.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.152
Women who use them long-term

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.736
have an increased risk of fractures.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.224
It is thought that reduced stomach acid 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.168
may slow the breakdown of calcium in the stomach

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.848
and reduce the amount absorbed from the small intestine. 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.104
This would reduce the amount of calcium

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.784
in the bloodstream and the amount

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.624
being absorbed by bones,

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.784
and could contribute to bone thinning 

00:01:10.784 --> 00:01:12.780
or osteoporosis.
