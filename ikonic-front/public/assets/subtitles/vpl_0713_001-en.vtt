00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.824
Insulin is a hormone.

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.184
Cells in your pancreas produce insulin

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:05.904
in response to glucose

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.264
a form of sugar in your bloodstream.

00:00:08.456 --> 00:00:11.272
Glucose is formed from the breakdown of foods.

00:00:11.488 --> 00:00:13.176
It attaches to receptors on

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.992
pancreatic cells called beta cells.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.416
They produce, store, and release

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.840
granules of insulin into your blood stream.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.944
The insulin attaches to receptors

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.696
on cells throughout your body.

00:00:25.016 --> 00:00:28.264
Normally, this allows the glucose to enter the cells,

00:00:28.328 --> 00:00:30.432
which use the glucose for fuel.

00:00:30.656 --> 00:00:33.104
In people with type 2 diabetes,

00:00:33.296 --> 00:00:35.040
different mechanisms can prevent

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.112
the glucose from entering the cell.

00:00:37.272 --> 00:00:39.624
Blood levels of glucose remain high,

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.920
which triggers the pancreas to keep producing insulin.

00:00:43.128 --> 00:00:45.112
Many people with type 2 diabetes

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.688
have normal or high levels of insulin;

00:00:47.968 --> 00:00:49.528
this can be enough to overcome 

00:00:49.528 --> 00:00:51.520
insulin resistance for a while.

00:00:51.648 --> 00:00:53.120
Eventually however,

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.328
the cycles of high glucose levels

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.376
and increased production of insulin

00:00:57.496 --> 00:00:59.240
can cause the pancreas to stop

00:00:59.248 --> 00:01:01.088
producing insulin altogether.
