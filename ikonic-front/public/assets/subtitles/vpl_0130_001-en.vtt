00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.304
If your child has a leg fracture,

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.320
it means there is a crack or break

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.272
in one of bones of the leg.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.136
These bones include the femur

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.368
in the upper leg,

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.320
the tibia, or shin bone,

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.584
and the fibula, or calf bone.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.800
If the fracture is at the growth plate

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.280
near the ends of the bone,

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.088
bone growth can be affected

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.464
and may require special

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.488
X-rays or other tests.

00:00:22.672 --> 00:00:24.464
Young bones are more flexible

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:25.376
than an adult’s,

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.272
so a child’s bone may crack

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.600
or just buckle without a clear break

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.128
instead of snapping like a dry stick.

00:00:32.536 --> 00:00:34.344
A leg fracture may be treated with

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.344
casts, splints, a removable boot,

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.664
or an air splint

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.816
worn for 4 to 8 weeks.

00:00:40.952 --> 00:00:42.424
Surgery may be needed

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.792
to straighten a broken bone

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:44.776
that is crooked

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.000
or broken into many pieces.

00:00:47.088 --> 00:00:48.536
Your child may need to use

00:00:48.544 --> 00:00:50.288
crutches for several weeks.
