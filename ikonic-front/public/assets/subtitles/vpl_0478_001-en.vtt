00:00:00.088 --> 00:00:02.488
Although far more common in women,

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.592
breast cancer can also develop in men.

00:00:05.872 --> 00:00:07.792
Before puberty, the breast tissue

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.040
in boys and girls is similar.

00:00:10.536 --> 00:00:13.160
In girls, female hormones produced

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.344
at puberty cause the growth of

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.408
milk-producing glands called lobules

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.184
and tiny tubes called ducts,

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.688
which carry milk from the lobules to the nipple

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.432
and an increase in fat and

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.472
connective tissue called stroma.

00:00:25.584 --> 00:00:27.712
Male hormones restrict further growth

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.584
of the breasts after puberty;

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.384
the tissue contains ducts

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.656
but few or no lobules.

00:00:33.768 --> 00:00:36.216
The duct cells in a man can undergo

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.808
cancerous changes,

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.000
but breast cancer is less common

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.704
because these cells are less developed.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.040
Also, the male breast tissue is not

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.536
exposed to the female hormone estrogen,

00:00:47.536 --> 00:00:49.530
as womenâ€™s breast tissue is.

00:00:49.712 --> 00:00:51.688
Factors that increase the risk of

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.984
breast cancer in men include increased age,

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.640
exposure to estrogen,

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.312
and very low levels of the

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.728
male hormone, testosterone.
