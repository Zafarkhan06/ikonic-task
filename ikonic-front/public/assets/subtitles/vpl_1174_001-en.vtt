Injectable fillers, also known as dermal fillers,

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.300
are used to
smooth wrinkles, improve acne scars,

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.800
and plump areas like lips, cheeks, and chins.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.860
Injectable fillers are usually gel-like substances

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.000
your doctor injects into the middle layer

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.120
of your skin, called the dermis.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.220
The gel fills sunken areas to reduce wrinkles

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.660
and plump up your skin.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.620
Some fillers help your body make collagen,

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.880
the protein that forms the building blocks of your skin.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.680
Your doctor will explain which type of filler is right for you.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.540
Depending on the type,

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.680
results may last several months or longer.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.460
After you get fillers, you may have side effects like

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.480
swelling, bruising, redness, pain, rash,

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.640
and itchiness at and around your injection site.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.960
More serious complications can happen if the filler

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.420
is accidentally injected into a blood vessel.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.280
Talk to your doctor if you have questions

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.420
about possible side effects.
