00:00:00.328 --> 00:00:02.384
In pyloric stenosis,

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:03.920
the muscle in the lower part

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.232
of your babyâ€™s stomach,

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:06.512
called the pylorus,

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.224
will not allow milk to pass

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.408
through into the small intestine.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.080
Normally, the pyloris contracts

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.696
or gets smaller to keep food in the stomach

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.048
and then relaxes,

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.328
growing larger to let food out.

00:00:19.656 --> 00:00:21.560
In pyloric stenosis,

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.560
the muscle is too big.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.272
It doesn't relax enough

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:26.904
so it stays tight.

00:00:27.032 --> 00:00:28.960
Symptoms may start when your baby

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.824
 is around 3 weeks old.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.512
They may include vomiting,

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:34.992
constipation, green diarrhea,

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.944
weight loss,

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.128
and stomach pain after eating.

00:00:38.312 --> 00:00:41.200
Pyloric stenosis is treated with surgery

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.008
to loosen the muscle so food

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.320
can pass easily out of the stomach.
