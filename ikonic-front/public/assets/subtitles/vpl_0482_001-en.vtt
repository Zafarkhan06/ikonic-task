00:00:00.704 --> 00:00:02.712
The large bowel, or colon,

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:04.816
absorbs water from the solid waste

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:07.056
left over after food digestion.

00:00:07.296 --> 00:00:09.208
Once water has been removed,

00:00:09.248 --> 00:00:11.576
the solid waste or fecal matter that is

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.696
formed is expelled from the body.

00:00:14.224 --> 00:00:17.824
In irritable bowel syndrome or IBS,

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.840
the smooth movement of fecal matter

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.624
through the colon is disrupted.

00:00:21.808 --> 00:00:23.552
This can result in diarrhea,

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.744
constipation,

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.896
or alternating bouts of both.
