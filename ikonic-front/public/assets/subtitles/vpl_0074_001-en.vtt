A column of bones called vertebrae

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:04.232
make up your spine.

00:00:04.424 --> 00:00:05.824
These bones are named

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:07.600
based on their location.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.232
The cervical vertebrae are in your neck.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.184
The thoracic vertebrae are in your upper back,

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:14.744
and the lumbar vertebrae

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.320
are in your lower back.

00:00:16.544 --> 00:00:18.280
The tailbone is actually

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.816
2 bones at the bottom of your spinal column

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.208
called the sacrum and coccyx.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.200
