00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.408
The home for a developing fetus

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.328
is the amniotic sac.

00:00:04.448 --> 00:00:05.920
Entering the birth canal

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.920
requires leaving the sac.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.776
The sac membrane breaks

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:11.920
and the amniotic fluid that filled it

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.704
about a quart by the final week of pregnancy

00:00:14.704 --> 00:00:16.700
flows out of the vagina.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.832
The amniotic sac membrane is

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.912
thought to help protect the baby’s head

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.968
during labor, against the opening cervix.

00:00:24.128 --> 00:00:27.136
Sometimes the sac membrane breaks naturally;

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.848
when a woman’s so-called “water breaks,”

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.000
and sometimes the sac is ruptured

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
by the birth attendant.
