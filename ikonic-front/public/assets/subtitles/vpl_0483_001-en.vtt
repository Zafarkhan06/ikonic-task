00:00:00.176 --> 00:00:01.864
The heart is a hollow muscle

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.536
about the size of your fist.

00:00:03.744 --> 00:00:05.736
It is located under your rib cage

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.080
between your lungs,

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.760
to the left of your breast bone or sternum.

00:00:09.944 --> 00:00:12.880
The heart functions as a two-sided pump,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.424
with a right side and a left side.

00:00:15.544 --> 00:00:17.808
Each side has two chambers,

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.952
an upper collecting chamber called the atrium

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.056
and a lower pumping chamber called the ventricle.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.216
The ventricles are the main force

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.976
for the circulation of blood throughout your body.

00:00:29.256 --> 00:00:32.192
The right atrium receives blood from the body

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:33.824
that is low in oxygen

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.440
and high in carbon dioxide waste.

00:00:36.768 --> 00:00:39.416
Blood then passes from the right atrium

00:00:39.416 --> 00:00:41.410
down into the right ventricle,

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.384
which pumps it into the lungs where

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.288
it releases carbon dioxide

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.864
and picks up a fresh oxygen supply.

00:00:48.176 --> 00:00:49.760
The left atrium receives

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.920
blood from the lungs with its fresh oxygen supply.

00:00:53.184 --> 00:00:56.656
Blood with oxygen then passes from the left atrium

00:00:56.656 --> 00:00:58.650
down into the left ventricle,

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.760
which pumps it to all the organs of the body.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.320
The normal heart beats about

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.648
60 to 100 times a minute.

00:01:07.192 --> 00:01:10.808
With each beat, blood moves in, through,

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.120
and out of the heart

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.568
to the rest of your body.
