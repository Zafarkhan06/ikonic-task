00:00:00.328 --> 00:00:03.528
What is a baby’s world before it is born?

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.064
Some might say it is the placenta,

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.832
which provides protection and early immunity,

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.040
delivers nutrients and oxygen,

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.408
and removes carbon dioxide and other waste.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.008
But beyond what the placenta provides,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.400
some other remarkable things are happening

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.744
as the baby’s senses develop.

00:00:21.888 --> 00:00:24.016
The embryo is touching and feeling

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.984
the world around it by 5 ½ weeks,

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.888
first as its lips and nose

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.648
touch the wall of the uterus

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.616
and then extending to the rest of the body.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.424
The sense of taste also develops early.

00:00:36.424 --> 00:00:38.420
By 9 weeks, the fetus

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.088
can taste some flavors,

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.408
and after 13 to 15 weeks,

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.712
the taste of amniotic fluid changes

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.664
constantly based on what the mother eats.

00:00:47.936 --> 00:00:50.416
A developing baby can also hear

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.312
most of the sounds are the movement of

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.568
its mother’s stomach and intestines,

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.192
and blood running through her blood vessels.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.296
But a developing baby can also hear

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.288
voices from outside the womb.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.552
By 24 weeks a baby recognizes

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.376
and is calmed--by its mother’s voice.

00:01:13.216 --> 00:01:16.544
And by 28 weeks, the baby’s sense of smell

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.216
takes in odors from things

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.480
the mother eats or inhales,

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.608
which pass from her blood through the

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.160
placenta to the amniotic fluid.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.136
Even the baby’s sense of sight

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.720
might be getting stimulation from

00:01:28.736 --> 00:01:30.632
some light coming through the womb,

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.672
especially when the mother is in bright light.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.200
In addition to hearing, tasting,

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.800
smelling, seeing, and touching,

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.704
the baby is also practicing

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.576
walking in the uterus.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.424
The mother feels these as kicking movements.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.336
And by the third trimester,

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.392
a sudden movement by the mother

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.704
will cause the baby to fling out its arms

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.208
and legs as if losing its balance.
