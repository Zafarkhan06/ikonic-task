00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320
We see through the process of light

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.112
being transmitted through the eye

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.288
to the retina, which converts light

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.384
into electrical impulses that are sent to the brain.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.552
The lens of the eye focuses light on the retina.

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:14.256
It is normally clear.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.256
A cataract is a clouding of the lens.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.056
It may be only slight or opaque, 

00:00:20.056 --> 00:00:22.050
so no light passes through.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.176
Some cataracts develop as part of the aging process.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.104
Proteins that are normally in a precise formation

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.912
become clumped, creating clouded areas

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:32.496
that can grow over time.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.304
A so-called senile cataract

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.392
often begins as discoloration of the lens

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.904
that grows until the lens is opaque.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.176
The lens first swells and then shrinks,

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.656
with complete loss of transparency.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.632
A cataract that forms in the center of the lens

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.672
can temporarily improve near-sightedness

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.752
but this disappears as the cataract worsens.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.592
As cataracts progress,

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.048
they can cause blurred or cloudy vision.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.736
Colors can become less bright or yellowed.

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.552
It can be harder to see at night.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.432
And light can seem glaring

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.872
or there may be a halo around lights.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:10.624
Steps to improve vision

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.384
for early cataracts include new glasses,

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.768
brighter lighting,

00:01:14.896 --> 00:01:16.760
antiglare sunglasses

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.776
and magnifying lenses.

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.304
If vision loss interferes with daily activities,

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.320
surgery may be recommended.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.592
It is the only effective treatment for cataracts.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.544
Surgery involves removing the cloudy lens

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.008
and replacing it with an artificial lens,

00:01:33.008 --> 00:01:35.000
which becomes part of your eye.
