The most common cause of colds and flu

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.680
is the rhinovirus, which lives in nasal passages.

00:00:13.888 --> 00:00:15.584
It enters through the nostrils

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.704
and passes to the back of the nose

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.144
where it invades cells

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.392
lining the upper area of the throat. 

00:00:21.696 --> 00:00:23.568
Runny nose and sinus congestion

are responses to a rhinovirus invasion.

00:00:26.968 --> 00:00:29.112
Nasal drainage increases as your body

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.008
tries to get rid of the virus.

00:00:31.224 --> 00:00:33.544
Inflammation and increased blood flow

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.008
to sinonasal tissues cause sinus congestion.
