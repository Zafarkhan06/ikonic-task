00:00:01.496 --> 00:00:05.208
In peripheral artery disease, or PAD,

00:00:05.544 --> 00:00:07.544
fatty material called plaque

00:00:07.648 --> 00:00:10.056
builds up inside the walls of arteries

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.712
that supply blood and oxygen to your limbs,

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:14.256
especially your legs.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.136
Plaque can reduce blood flow,

00:00:17.288 --> 00:00:19.000
so the muscle cells in your legs

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.864
donâ€™t get the oxygen they need.

00:00:21.136 --> 00:00:23.016
Depending on the severity,

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.272
treatment for PAD can include

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.056
lifestyle changes, medications,

00:00:28.216 --> 00:00:31.152
and interventional and surgical procedures.

00:00:31.568 --> 00:00:33.392
Lifestyle changes are designed

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.472
to reduce the factors that contribute to the disease,

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.960
like quitting smoking and losing excess weight. 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.016
Medications can help improve blood flow

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.384
and treat conditions like

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.176
high blood pressure and high cholesterol. 

00:00:47.416 --> 00:00:50.496
Interventional and surgical procedures may be used

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.800
to treat more severe PAD.

00:00:53.072 --> 00:00:54.344
In a procedure called 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.632
percutaneous transluminal angioplasty - PTA,

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.832
or just angioplasty,

00:01:01.136 --> 00:01:03.848
a long thin tube called a catheter

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.528
with a balloon on its tip

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.984
is inserted into the blocked artery.

00:01:08.128 --> 00:01:10.896
The balloon is inflated to flatten the plaque

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.576
against the artery wall.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.232
Sometimes a mesh-like device called a stent

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.552
is left in place to help keep the artery open.

00:01:19.736 --> 00:01:22.648
The blockage may also be surgically removed.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.840
In some cases, a bypass procedure may be performed

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.320
to reroute blood flow around the blocked area.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.320
If you have PAD,

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.120
talk to your doctor about the best

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.792
treatment options for you 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.216
and how you can keep it from progressing.
