00:00:00.184 --> 00:00:03.744
Cancer is a disease of abnormal cell growth.

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.032
Normal cells stay in a balance

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.152
producing new cells as the old cells are dying.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.520
But cancer cells multiply uncontrollably

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.208
and do not die at the same rate.

00:00:15.368 --> 00:00:18.480
Chemotherapy drugs are used to kill cancer cells,

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.904
so they stop multiplying and die.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.960
But unfortunately, even normal cells,

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.136
especially those that are fast growing,

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.704
can be affected by chemotherapy.

00:00:28.888 --> 00:00:31.248
When fast growing normal cells die

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.656
faster than they should,

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.816
it can lead to side effects.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.368
Damaging normal cells in the hair follicles for example,

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.000
causes hair loss.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.288
Important blood cells can also be damaged.

00:00:43.488 --> 00:00:47.648
Neutropenia, a low amount of a type of white blood cell,

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.544
can put patients at risk for infection.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.504
Chemotherapy is scheduled with a

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.648
period of rest between cycles

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.440
to allow your body to recover from side effects

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.968
due to damage to normal cells.

00:01:00.144 --> 00:01:02.416
The exact schedule your doctor develops

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.088
is based on many things,

00:01:04.088 --> 00:01:06.080
including the drugs being used,

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.128
and the type of cancer you have.

00:01:08.344 --> 00:01:10.384
There are planned breaks between treatment

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.480
to give normal healthy cells the chance to recover.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.480
Despite these planned breaks,

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.072
sometimes people undergoing chemotherapy

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.872
need unplanned delays.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.920
or must stop treatment because of side effects.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.616
While these unplanned gaps in chemotherapy

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.232
treatment allow recovery from side effects,

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.448
they can also allow cancer cells to start growing again.

00:01:32.592 --> 00:01:35.376
Side effects can affect your treatment plan.

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.040
Talk to your doctor about ways to manage them.
