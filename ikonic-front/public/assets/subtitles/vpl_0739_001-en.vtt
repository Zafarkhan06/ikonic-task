00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.832
Your vocal cords allow you speak.

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.432
Normally, as air passes over these mucous membranes,

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.208
they vibrate and produce different sounds.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.752
When they become irritated or inflamed,

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.160
you experience laryngitis.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.560
It can cause a hoarse or raspy sound

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.624
and, if severe, cause you to “lose your voice”

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.896
or experience a blocked airway.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.024
Laryngitis can be caused by several factors:

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.424
Acid reflux

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:27.976
Yelling and strain

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:28.984
Virus

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.688
Bacterial infection

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:31.576
Injury

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:32.480
Allergies

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:33.504
Smoking

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.064
In most cases,

00:00:35.088 --> 00:00:37.480
laryngitis is not a serious condition

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.184
and it goes away on its own within two weeks.

00:00:40.288 --> 00:00:42.984
Chronic laryngitis may be the result of a

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.872
more serious condition such as nerve damage,

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.008
polyps or hard or thick lumps known as nodules.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.992
If you suspect that you have chronic laryngitis,

00:00:52.992 --> 00:00:54.990
visit your doctor.
