00:00:04.144 --> 00:00:06.608
Your child’s tonsils and adenoids help

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.544
prevent infection by trapping germs.

00:00:09.928 --> 00:00:11.800
But tonsils and adenoids can

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.248
become more harmful than helpful.

00:00:14.456 --> 00:00:16.888
Your tonsils are two small lumps of tissue

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.424
in the back of your throat.

00:00:18.712 --> 00:00:20.896
Adenoids are also lumps of tissue,

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.560
but higher in the throat, behind your nose. 

00:00:23.816 --> 00:00:25.848
A tonsillectomy is surgery

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.696
to remove your tonsils.

00:00:27.776 --> 00:00:29.864
An adenoidectomy is surgery 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.728
to remove your adenoids.

00:00:31.872 --> 00:00:34.552
Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy are often

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.536
done at the same time, called a T&A.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.784
You may have a T&A for:

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.368
Frequent infections of your

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.056
nose and throat, or

00:00:43.072 --> 00:00:44.408
Infections that don’t

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.512
go away with antibiotics

00:00:46.704 --> 00:00:48.624
Ongoing swelling of your tonsils

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.392
or adenoids can cause:

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.608
Sore throat and trouble swallowing

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.672
Snoring and sleep problems related to breathing

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.704
Trouble breathing through your nose

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.240
Runny nose, and

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.464
Frequent ear infections

00:01:01.848 --> 00:01:03.592
Before T&A surgery,

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.536
follow your doctor’s directions for

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.280
eating, drinking and taking medicine.

00:01:08.608 --> 00:01:10.352
During T&A surgery,

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.240
you will have general anesthesia

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.896
so you will be asleep and pain-free.

00:01:15.112 --> 00:01:17.856
Your doctor removes the tonsils and adenoids

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.104
using tools that can reach them.

00:01:20.216 --> 00:01:23.632
Surgery takes between 30 and 60 minutes.

00:01:23.832 --> 00:01:25.512
After T&A surgery,

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.512
you can usually go home within a few hours.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.400
If your child has frequent

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.128
nose and throat infections,

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.832
ask your doctor if surgery can help.
