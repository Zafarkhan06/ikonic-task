00:00:00.344 --> 00:00:02.008
Skin all over the body

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.960
constantly sheds dead cells

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.280
from the outer layer or epidermis.

00:00:06.344 --> 00:00:08.008
Dandruff refers to large,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.552
loose flakes of skin shed from the scalp,

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:12.056
which can cling to the hair

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:13.888
or fall onto the shoulders.

00:00:14.104 --> 00:00:16.088
The skin in those with dandruff

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.832
is thought to shed more often

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.272
than in those without it.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.368
The skin between the shafts of

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.944
hair on the scalp is comparatively loose.

00:00:24.312 --> 00:00:25.992
Just beneath the surface,

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.344
a mixture of yeast and

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.304
bacteria often develops,

00:00:29.392 --> 00:00:32.080
particularly in those with oily skin.

00:00:32.584 --> 00:00:34.208
The number of yeast cells

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.304
and bacteria

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.536
are often higher in those with dandruff

00:00:37.592 --> 00:00:39.512
and many scientists believe that

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.856
 this combination is the

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.648
actual cause of dandruff.
