00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960
Rheumatoid arthritis or RA,

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.440
is a chronic inflammatory disease that

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.320
causes pain and swelling in joints.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.320
The causes of RA is not well understood,

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.520
but it is believed to be the result of the immune system

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.820
attacking the lining of your joints.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.580
Causing a painful swelling

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.380
that can eventually result in bone loss and joint deformity.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.940
Although there is no cure for RA,

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.220
there are treatments that slow down joint degeneration

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.720
and reduce the effects of RA.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.020
One of these treatments is called TNF-alpha inhibitors.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.760
TNF-alpha plays a major role in RA inflammation.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.640
TNF-alpha which is secreted by immune cells,

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.660
regulate signaling to other immune cells

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.620
to attack bone and cartilage cells.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.100
This is what leads to swelling, pain and joint deterioration.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.120
TNF-alpha inhibitors block the action of TNF-alpha

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.820
which prevents TNF-alpha from recruiting immune cells

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.800
to cause more inflammation.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.700
TNF-alpha inhibitors aren't a cure for RA,

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.760
but they do help reduce pain,

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.500
morning stiffness and tender or swollen joints.
