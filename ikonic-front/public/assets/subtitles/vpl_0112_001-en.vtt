00:00:00.496 --> 00:00:02.200
When your child’s immune system

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.888
detects a harmful substance or infection,

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.552
it responds to protect

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:08.008
your child’s body.

00:00:08.272 --> 00:00:10.376
Allergies occur when the immune system

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.280
reacts to a harmless substance

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.808
as if it were harmful.

00:00:14.376 --> 00:00:16.608
An allergic reaction does not occur

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.008
with the first exposure to a substance.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.736
Your child’s body must have been

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.992
exposed at least once before.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.608
After one allergic reaction,

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.552
further contact with the substance

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.640
produces another reaction.

00:00:29.816 --> 00:00:32.008
Substances that produce allergies

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.984
are called allergens.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.984
Common ones include mold,

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.528
animal dander, dust and dust mites,

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.568
latex, medicines, insect stings, and foods.

00:00:42.952 --> 00:00:45.152
Some allergens like mold and pollen

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:46.800
are carried through the air.

00:00:47.016 --> 00:00:49.000
These allergens cause hay fever

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.696
and its symptoms of sneezing,

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.432
watery eyes, and a stuffy

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:53.904
or runny nose.

00:00:54.064 --> 00:00:55.720
Touching an irritant can cause

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.752
allergic skin reactions.

00:00:57.888 --> 00:01:00.240
Common causes of a skin allergy

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.664

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.992
metals in jewelry such as nickel,

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:07.400
fabric dyes, and poison ivy.

00:01:07.728 --> 00:01:09.984
Symptoms include itching, swelling,

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.816
and a rash or hives.

00:01:12.176 --> 00:01:14.448
