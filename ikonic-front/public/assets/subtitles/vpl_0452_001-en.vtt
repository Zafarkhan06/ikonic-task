00:00:00.856 --> 00:00:03.680
H1N1 is a new type of influenza,

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.200
or flu, virus.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.088
It is thought to spread mainly by

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.680
coughing and sneezing,

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.672
which spreads infectious particles

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.288
that others breathe in.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.320
Flu viruses typically infect

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.824
cells lining the nose,

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.336
throat, and lungs.

00:00:17.616 --> 00:00:20.136
Proteins on the virus’s outer coat

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.264
bind to receptors on the surface

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.136
of a normal human cell.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.784
Through a process called endocytosis,

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:28.648
the virus’s outer proteins

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.104
merge with the cell’s outer membrane

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.456
and the virus enters the cell.

00:00:33.624 --> 00:00:35.184
Inside the cell,

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.672
the virus is transported

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:37.896
to an acidic area

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.512
called the endosome.

00:00:39.616 --> 00:00:41.768
The acidity causes the viral

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.528
core to disassemble.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.184
The core contains viral proteins

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.736
and 8 segments of viral RNA,

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.848
which carry the virus’s genetic information.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.808
Each RNA strand

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.760
enters the cell’s nucleus,

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.032
where it is copied,

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.336
first as a template

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.096
and then many times.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.064
Viral proteins are also reproduced.

00:01:03.192 --> 00:01:05.608
The different components join together

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.184
outside the nucleus

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.592
to form new viral particles.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.912
They travel to the surface of the cell,

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.952
where they acquire a protein coat

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.464
and are released to spread

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.432
to other cells and people.
