00:00:01.384 --> 00:00:04.720
Your heart has four compartments or chambers.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.128
The right chambers hold returning blood

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.168
and pump it into the lungs.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.320
The left chambers collect and pump

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.160
oxygenated blood to the rest of the body.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.592
The upper chambers or atria hold the blood

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.680
and the ventricles on the bottom pump it out. 

00:00:20.992 --> 00:00:24.160
The aortic valve is on the left side of the heart.

00:00:24.272 --> 00:00:26.784
It opens to let blood flow from the left

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:28.672
ventricle into the aorta,

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.264
which carries blood to the rest of the body.

00:00:31.264 --> 00:00:33.260
It closes between heartbeats

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.376
to keep blood from moving back into the ventricle.

00:00:36.616 --> 00:00:39.048
When the aortic valve doesn’t open

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.536
or close as it should,

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.920
the heart has to work harder to pump enough

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.536
blood through the valve into the aorta.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.176
This can cause symptoms such as chest pain

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.720
and shortness of breath.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.720
A common cause

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.896
is being born with a valve that has one or two

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.208
rather than three tissue flaps, called leaflets.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.240
This can prevent the valve from opening properly

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:06.272
called stenosis—or closing properly—called regurgitation.

00:01:06.544 --> 00:01:08.264
Another common cause is that

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.776
the valve becomes worn with age.

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.624
When this happens, the body

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.936
deposits calcium on the leaflets,

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.560
which can limit their movements so

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.256
they can’t fully open or close.

00:01:19.408 --> 00:01:21.496
A faulty aortic valve may need

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.272
to be surgically replaced with an

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.592
artificial or prosthetic valve.
