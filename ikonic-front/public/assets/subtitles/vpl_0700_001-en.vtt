00:00:00.352 --> 00:00:02.088
People sneeze when the lining

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.248
of the nose becomes irritated.

00:00:04.392 --> 00:00:07.880
This stimulates nerve endings inside your nose.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.864
The nerves send signals to a part

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.280
of the brain called the sneezing center.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.696
The brain sends out signals to the nerves that

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.792
control all the muscles involved in the sneeze.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.352
You take a deep breath

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.344
and your throat, eyes, and mouth close.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.888
Pressure builds up inside your chest.

00:00:24.888 --> 00:00:26.880
Then your chest muscles contract

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.024
and your throat opens suddenly.

00:00:29.112 --> 00:00:31.136
You breathe out explosively,

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.888
as the pressurized air flows back up your airway.
