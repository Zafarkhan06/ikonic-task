00:00:00.464 --> 00:00:02.312
A forearm fracture means the

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:03.728
the radius or ulna,

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.096
the bones in the forearm,

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:07.048
is cracked or broken.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.304
Young bones are more

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.944
flexible than older ones.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.688
So a child's bone may crack

00:00:11.688 --> 00:00:13.680
or buckle without a clear break

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.208
rather than snapping like an adults.

00:00:16.504 --> 00:00:18.080
Bone growth can be affected

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.784
by a fracture at the growth plate

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.440
near the ends of the bone.

00:00:21.568 --> 00:00:22.992
A fracture in this area

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.024
may require special x-rays, or other tests.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.352
If the broken bone is crooked

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.024
it will need to be straightened.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.736
This may require surgery,

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.328
especially if the bone is broken

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.024
into many pieces.

00:00:35.192 --> 00:00:36.800
A splint may be worn until the

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.112
swelling goes down.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:39.560
Followed by a cast for

00:00:39.568 --> 00:00:41.168
4 to 8 weeks.
