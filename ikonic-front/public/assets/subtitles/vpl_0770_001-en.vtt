00:00:00.512 --> 00:00:03.136
When the left and right lower chambers of the heart

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:04.984
do not beat in sync,

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.600
A doctor may suggest

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.800
Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy, or CRT.

00:00:10.912 --> 00:00:14.536
It may also be called Biventricular Pacing.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.792
CRT uses an implantable cardiac defibrillator, or ICD,

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.280
which is inserted into the chest.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.776
A doctor inserts tiny wires, called "leads,"

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.728
Into the vein just below the collarbone.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.552
Two leads are attached to the heart muscle,

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.872
in the upper right and lower right chambers.

00:00:34.992 --> 00:00:37.488
A third lead runs through a small opening

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.344
in the upper right chamber.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.648
It runs from the back side of the heart

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.568
to the front, and attaches to the lower left chamber

00:00:45.808 --> 00:00:48.496
The leads all connect to a pacing device

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.776
that is inserted into a small opening in the chest.

00:00:51.864 --> 00:00:55.224
This device constatly monitors the heartbeat.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.888
If it is out of sync,

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.760
the pacemaker sends a tiny

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.576
electrical pulse to the heart

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.224
to correct the rhythm.

00:01:02.544 --> 00:01:04.744
If the heartbeat is not corrected,

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:07.752
The ICD will send a high-energy shock

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.040
to restart the heart's rhythm.
