00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.480
Your heart needs oxygen and nutrients to survive.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.860
The coronary arteries supply blood containing oxygen

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.120
and nutrients to the heart.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.540
A thick, fatty substance, called plaque,

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.480
can build up in these arteries

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.400
causing blood flow to be slowed or blocked.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.560
Coronary bypass surgery creates a new route

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.020
for blood around a section of a blocked

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.820
or partially blocked artery in your heart.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.320
The procedure involves using a healthy artery or vein

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.960
from another part of your body and connecting it

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.140
above and below the blockage in your heart.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.600
The procedure is often referred to as a CABG,

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.380
for Coronary Artery Bypass Graft.
