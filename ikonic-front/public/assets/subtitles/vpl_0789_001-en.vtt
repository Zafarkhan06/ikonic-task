00:00:00.536 --> 00:00:02.432
Your liver is a large organ

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:04.368
located primarily in the right

00:00:04.368 --> 00:00:06.360
upper quadrant of your abdomen.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.304
It lies under your diaphragm

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.976
and to the right of your stomach

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.240
and is protected by your ribcage.

00:00:12.504 --> 00:00:14.992
Your liver is responsible for many metabolic

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.256
and filtration functions in the body.

00:00:17.488 --> 00:00:20.504
Most importantly, the liver filters your blood

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.008
before returning it to your heart

00:00:22.008 --> 00:00:24.000
to pump it to the rest of the body.

00:00:25.232 --> 00:00:27.056
It also produces bile,

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.416
a fluid necessary for emulsifying fats during digestion.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.744
Your liver is divided into two halves;

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.160
which are further divided into four segments each.

00:00:39.536 --> 00:00:41.360
When cancer develops within

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.520
or migrates to the liver,

00:00:43.616 --> 00:00:47.368
a liver resection is often part of the necessary treatment.

00:00:47.528 --> 00:00:51.312
A liver resection is the removal of a portion of the liver.

00:00:51.656 --> 00:00:53.736
Before beginning a liver resection,

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.672
the patient is put under general anesthesia.

00:00:57.048 --> 00:00:58.816
The operation may be performed

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.976
through an incision, known as an open approach.

00:01:02.136 --> 00:01:04.496
Or through several small incisions,

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:08.808
known as a laparoscopic or robotic assisted approach.

00:01:09.128 --> 00:01:10.944
Your surgeon will then remove the

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.688
portion of the liver affected by cancer.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.960
This may involve as little as a small wedge,

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.504
to several segments or sections,

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.944
to a full lobe or more being removed.

00:01:23.408 --> 00:01:25.368
Your liver is one of the few organs

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.112
in your body with the ability to regenerate.

00:01:28.224 --> 00:01:32.536
It typically grows back to its original size in 3 months.

00:01:32.704 --> 00:01:35.304
A liver resection is usually very successful

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.552
at eliminating cancer in the liver.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.550
It is a major operation that

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.160
usually takes 2-4 hours.

00:01:42.376 --> 00:01:44.344
Most patients are fully recovered and

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.928
back to daily routines within a week.
