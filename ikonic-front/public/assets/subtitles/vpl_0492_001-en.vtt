00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.576
A baby’s brain grows rapidly

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:05.024
during the last trimester of pregnancy,

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:06.896
triples in size during the first

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:08.264
year after birth,

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.416
and continues to develop rapidly

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.936
throughout the first 2 years of life.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.152
Fat makes up more than half of

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.872
the brain’s dry weight.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:18.944
 primary fat in nerve cells of

00:00:18.944 --> 00:00:20.940
the developing and infant brain

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.368
is docosahexaenoic acid or DHA.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.624
One important role for DHA

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.496
is as a component of myelin,

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.536
which covers nerve fibers.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.624
Myelin ensures that nerve

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:35.352
impulses move quickly and correctly.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:36.960
With less myelin,

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.112
impulses travel more slowly,

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:40.992
delaying movement of information

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.024
from one cell to the next.

00:00:43.264 --> 00:00:45.328
There is also a high concentration of

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.600
DHA in the junctions between nerve cells.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.608
Nerve cells communicate across

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.136
these junctions, called synapses.

00:00:53.224 --> 00:00:55.912
Peak formation of synapses begins at

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.832
34 weeks’ gestation and continues

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.520
through the first 24 months of life.

00:01:01.808 --> 00:01:04.632
DHA is also a primary component of

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:06.272
nerve cells in the retina,

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.296
the light-sensitive tissue lining the

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.160
inner surface of the eye.

00:01:10.416 --> 00:01:12.512
DHA is a member of the family of

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.536
omega-3 fatty acids.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.240
Essential fatty acids or EFA’s

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.504
must be obtained from your diet.

00:01:19.784 --> 00:01:21.144
Cold water fish,

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.976
a traditional source of dietary DHA,

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.856
get DHA from algae in their diet.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.856
However, many fish today are farm-raised

00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:31.850
and fed corn and soy meal

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.064
and only wild salmon and trout

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.856
consistently supply DHA.

00:01:37.192 --> 00:01:39.688
Breast milk, unlike cow’s milk,

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.832
contains a significant amount of DHA.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.528
Levels depend on the mother’s diet.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.328
Other good sources are foods

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.624
fortified with algal-DHA

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.808
which comes directly from algae,

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.304
and algal-DHA supplements.
