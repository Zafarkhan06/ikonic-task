00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:05.410
A Cesarean or C-section means a baby is delivered

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:07.380
through an incision in the abdomen

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.430
rather than through the vagina.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.370
The incision is usually horizontal

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.730
and just above the pubic hair line

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.730
but may also be done vertically from the belly button downwards.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.020
A C-section may be planned if a problem birth is suspected

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.690
or used as an emergency procedure if unexpected problems arise.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.860
The baby and placenta are delivered from the uterus

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.390
and the incisions are closed with stitches.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.780
As with all major surgeries

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.800
there are risks with this procedure.
