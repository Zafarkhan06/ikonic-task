00:00:00.808 --> 00:00:03.568
Atrial fibrillation, or a fib,

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.552
happens when the two upper chambers

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:07.600
of the heart, or the atria,

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.768
beat out of sync

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.872
with the lower two chambers, or the ventricles.

00:00:12.088 --> 00:00:13.712
This is due to problems with the

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.176
electrical signal that controls the heartbeat.

00:00:17.432 --> 00:00:19.696
Pulmonary vein isolation

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.488
is a common way to correct a fib.

00:00:22.624 --> 00:00:24.480
A thin, flexible tube

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.840
called a catheter

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.840
is inserted into a vessel in the leg.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.240
Sometimes a vessel in the neck is used instead.

00:00:32.592 --> 00:00:34.240
The catheter is guided to the

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.792
upper chambers of the heart

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.136
to reach the openings

00:00:37.136 --> 00:00:39.130
to the pulmonary veins.

00:00:39.384 --> 00:00:41.136
Passed through the catheter

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.336
are very small tools.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.616
One of these acts as a guide.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.608
The other creates a small circular wound

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.584
on the wall of the atrium.

00:00:50.752 --> 00:00:54.680
This is repeated for all four pulmonary veins.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.392
Within a few weeks,

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.008
the wounds create scar tissue.

00:00:59.176 --> 00:01:01.448
The scar tissue acts as a barrier

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.352
between the veins and the rest of the heart.

00:01:04.544 --> 00:01:07.080
This keeps the veins’ electrical impulses

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.720
from disrupting the heart’s normal rhythm.

00:01:10.088 --> 00:01:13.096
Once all the scar tissue is fully formed,

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.320
a patient’s heartbeat should return to normal.
