00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.248
During delivery, some women experience

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.736
burning or stinging in the perineum,

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.880
the diamond-shaped area incorporating

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.600
the vagina and rectum.

00:00:09.848 --> 00:00:13.176
This feeling, referred to as the ring of fire,

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.248
occurs as the vaginal opening

00:00:15.248 --> 00:00:17.240
is stretched during crowning,

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.184
when the babyâ€™s head emerges from the vagina.

00:00:20.288 --> 00:00:23.128
This burning or stinging is brief.

00:00:23.224 --> 00:00:25.728
The perineum then becomes numb as

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.616
vaginal tissue stretches

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.048
and nerves in the area are blocked.

00:00:30.232 --> 00:00:33.088
When a woman experiences the ring of fire,

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.616
she is often advised to stop pushing

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.224
and focus instead on deep breathing

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.672
and relaxing the perineal area.
