00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.776
A middle ear infection is

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.136
caused by swelling in the

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:04.592
tube between the middle ear

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:05.512
and the throat

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:07.424
called the Eustachian tube.

00:00:07.632 --> 00:00:09.256
The swelling traps fluid

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:10.400
in the middle ear,

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.232
allowing bacteria to grow

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:13.880
and cause infection.

00:00:14.312 --> 00:00:16.136
Ear tubes may be recommended

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:18.792
for a child with many ear infections.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.608
The plastic tubes are tiny and soft.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.688
They let air into the middle ear

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.400
while draining fluid out,

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.888
which helps to reduce infections.

00:00:28.352 --> 00:00:30.048
A surgeon places the tubes

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.456
using a microscope.

00:00:31.616 --> 00:00:33.984
A small cut is made in the eardrum

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.392
and fluid drains out

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:36.696
from the middle ear.

00:00:36.944 --> 00:00:39.328
The tube is put in the eardrum hole.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.360
About an hour after the surgery,

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.240
your child can go home.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.088
The tubes stay in place

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.232
without stitches

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.784
and most are slowly pushed

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.696
out of the eardrums naturally,

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.080
falling out of the ears

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.664
6 to 12 months after surgery.
