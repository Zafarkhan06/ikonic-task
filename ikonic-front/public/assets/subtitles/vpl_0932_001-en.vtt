00:09.852 --> 00:15.538
The novel, or new, coronavirus, officially named SARS-CoV-2

00:15.538 --> 00:17.664
is spread through droplets in the air

00:17.664 --> 00:19.361
after coughing or sneezing,

00:19.361 --> 00:21.724
which people nearby can take in through

00:21.724 --> 00:23.637
their nose, mouth or eyes.

00:23.637 --> 00:27.804
The virus can also spread by touching a contaminated surface,

00:27.804 --> 00:30.853
but it’s unclear how long the virus lives on surfaces.

00:30.853 --> 00:33.127
Once inside your body,

00:33.127 --> 00:36.692
the virus travels quickly to the back of your nasal passages

00:36.692 --> 00:39.932
and to the mucous membranes in the back of your throat.

00:39.932 --> 00:42.396
The virus attaches to a receptor called

00:42.396 --> 00:46.588
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, or ACE2,

00:46.588 --> 00:49.164
on respiratory cells in your body.

00:49.164 --> 00:52.638
The virus’s genetic material enters your cells.

00:52.638 --> 00:55.849
The virus then “hijacks” your cells to produce

00:55.849 --> 00:59.781
copies of itself which go on to infect more cells.

00:59.781 --> 01:02.493
Symptoms often start in the back of the throat,

01:02.493 --> 01:04.757
with a dry cough and sore throat,

01:04.757 --> 01:06.285
along with a fever.

01:06.285 --> 01:08.708
Symptoms become more severe as the infection

01:08.708 --> 01:12.297
starts making its way to your lower respiratory tract.

01:12.297 --> 01:16.976
Here, it can cause more respiratory problems like bronchitis and pneumonia.

01:16.976 --> 01:19.273
When the virus reaches your lungs,

01:19.273 --> 01:22.089
it causes inflammation in the air sacs in your lungs,

01:22.089 --> 01:24.241
which are called alveoli.

01:24.241 --> 01:29.296
Your alveoli are where oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged.

01:29.296 --> 01:32.672
In pneumonia there is swelling, decreased airflow,

01:32.672 --> 01:35.676
and your alveoli start to fill with fluid,

01:35.676 --> 01:38.624
causing shortness of breath and difficulty breathing.

01:38.624 --> 01:43.332
Less oxygen in your blood deprives other major organs of oxygen

01:43.332 --> 01:46.480
including your liver, kidney and brain.

01:46.480 --> 01:48.838
Acute respiratory distress,

01:48.838 --> 01:51.229
caused by widespread swelling in the lungs,

01:51.229 --> 01:55.401
stops your body from getting the oxygen it needs to survive.

01:55.401 --> 02:01.589
This respiratory distress can lead to organ failure and death.
