00:00:00.552 --> 00:00:01.984
The normal heartbeat

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:03.928
begins with electrical impulses

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.224
from the sinoatrial or SA node

00:00:06.336 --> 00:00:07.696
a group of specialized

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:10.136
pacemaker cells in the right atrium.

00:00:10.376 --> 00:00:12.584
These impulses cause the atria

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.448
to contract and push blood

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.944
into the ventricles.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.880
The impulse travels down

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.160
to a junction called

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.944
the atrioventricular or AV node.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.848
It then moves to the ventricles,

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.840
which contract and pump blood out

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.056
to the lungs and the rest of the body.

00:00:28.328 --> 00:00:30.784
In people with atrial fibrillation,

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.072
a chaotic electrical signal in the upper

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.024
part of the heart

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.408
produces a change in heart rhythm.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.648
The atrial muscles quiver.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.000
Electrical signals to the lower chambers

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.592
of the heart are irregular,

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:43.992
so that the heartbeat may be

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:45.448
fast and irregular,

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.096
and the heart may have more trouble

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:48.896
pumping efficiently.
