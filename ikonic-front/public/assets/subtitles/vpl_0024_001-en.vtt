00:00:00.976 --> 00:00:01.864
The heart

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.288
is a muscle about the size of your fist.

00:00:04.648 --> 00:00:06.392
It lies behind and to the left

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.288
of your breastbone, or sternum.

00:00:09.056 --> 00:00:10.280
The purpose of the heart

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.376
is to pump blood through blood vessels,

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:14.232
arteries, and veins

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.168
to all parts of your body.

00:00:16.608 --> 00:00:17.760
The inside of the heart

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.712
is divided into four chambers.

00:00:20.592 --> 00:00:21.704
The top two chambers

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.072
are called the atria

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.192
and are collection chambers for blood.

00:00:25.936 --> 00:00:27.120
The bottom two chambers

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.712
are called the ventricles

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.728
and receive the blood from the atria

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.032
and pump it to the lungs

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:33.064
and the body.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.176
The chambers are separated

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:36.240
by valves,

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.664
which control the direction of blood flow.

00:00:39.144 --> 00:00:41.008
There are four valves:

00:00:41.216 --> 00:00:42.600
Tricuspid,

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.008
Pulmonic,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.176
Mitral,

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.600
and Aortic.

00:00:47.576 --> 00:00:48.760
Circulation begins

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.296
at the right side of the heart

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:51.536
where blood from the body

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.136
comes to the right atrium.

00:00:53.872 --> 00:00:55.088
This blood passes to

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.248
the right ventricle

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.920
where it is pumped to the lungs

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.208
to receive oxygen.

00:01:00.256 --> 00:01:01.984
Once it receives oxygen,

00:01:02.048 --> 00:01:04.056
it flows to the left atrium

00:01:04.128 --> 00:01:05.944
and then to the left ventricle

00:01:06.112 --> 00:01:07.940
where it is pumped to the aorta

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.280
and the rest of the body.

00:01:10.272 --> 00:01:12.080
On the right side of the heart,

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.016
the tricuspid valve separates

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.296
the right atrium and the right ventricle,

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.672
allowing blood to enter the ventricle,

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.136
but not flow backwards to the atrium.

00:01:21.992 --> 00:01:24.144
Blood flows through the pulmonic valve

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.392
to go to the lungs.

00:01:26.288 --> 00:01:27.976
On the left side of the heart,

00:01:28.048 --> 00:01:30.648
the mitral valve separates the left atrium

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.200
and the left ventricle.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.672
Blood flows from the left ventricle

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:35.688
to the aorta

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.296
through the aortic valve

00:01:37.408 --> 00:01:39.192
and to the rest of the body.

00:01:40.032 --> 00:01:42.304
Arteries carry blood with oxygen

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.736
and other nutrients throughout the body.

00:01:44.984 --> 00:01:47.288
Veins take blood back to the heart,

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.688
which pumps it to the lungs

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.120
to be oxygenated.

00:01:50.672 --> 00:01:52.224
The heart arteries

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.672
(coronary arteries)

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.328
provide oxygen and nutrients

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.904
to the heart muscle.

00:01:57.312 --> 00:01:58.976
The right coronary artery

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.440
supplies blood to the bottom

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.032
and the back of the heart.

00:02:02.312 --> 00:02:03.792
The left coronary artery

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.664
splits into two vessels.

00:02:05.976 --> 00:02:07.304
One branch supplies blood

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.680
to the front of the heart.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.152
The other branch delivers blood

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:11.784
to the left side of the heart.

00:02:13.128 --> 00:02:15.368
An electric system transmits signals

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.768
throughout the heart to control its pumping.

00:02:18.368 --> 00:02:20.000
The electrical signal starts

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.752
in the sinoatrial or SA node,

00:02:22.928 --> 00:02:24.712
which is located in the upper portion

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.072
of the right atrium

00:02:26.136 --> 00:02:27.264
and is known as the

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.288
natural pacemaker of the heart.

00:02:30.152 --> 00:02:31.768
The electrical signal passes

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.728
down to the lower chambers of the heart

00:02:33.848 --> 00:02:35.720
via the atrioventricular

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.304
or AV node,

00:02:37.352 --> 00:02:38.696
which controls the signals

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.352
so the atria contract

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.136
before the ventricles.

00:02:42.872 --> 00:02:44.160
In the ventricles,

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.016
pathways carry the signal throughout

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.008
the muscle so that they contract

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.936
at the same time to pump blood

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.984
to the lungs and through the body.
