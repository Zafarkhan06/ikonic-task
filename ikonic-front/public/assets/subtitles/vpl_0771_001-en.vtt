00:00:01.152 --> 00:00:03.136
Pacemakers are used to correct 

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:04.984
different problems in the heart,

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.040
but mostly they are used to correct

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.880
a slow or irregular heartbeat.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.264
The pacemaker is a small device

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:13.896
implanted in the chest

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.872
to monitor and correct the heart's rhythm.

00:00:17.328 --> 00:00:18.870
The doctor begins

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.040
by inserting one or two very thin wires,

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.904
called "leads," into a vein under the collarbone.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.736
The leads are fed through the vein

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.064
and into the heart.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.816
Leads may be attached to either the top

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.456
or bottom of the heart, or both.

00:00:34.728 --> 00:00:37.304
The leads are connected to the pacing device,

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.432
and the device is implanted under the skin.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.664
If a heart rate is too slow, or irregular,

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.648
the pacemaker will send electrical impulses

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.424
through the leads to the heart,

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.520
in order to reset the heartbeat

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.520
to a normal pace.
