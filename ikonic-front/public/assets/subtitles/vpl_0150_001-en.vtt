00:00:00.616 --> 00:00:02.112
Estrogens are a group of

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:04.048
25 steroid hormones

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.824
that regulate several body functions

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:07.512
in both men and women.

00:00:08.128 --> 00:00:10.688
In women, it is the primary sex hormone

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.392
and is produced in the ovaries

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:13.616
from cholesterol.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.160
It is released into the

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.968
blood stream from the ovaries,

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.920
and within seconds it is transported

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.536
to all parts of the body.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.648
Estrogen works by crossing into

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.128
body cells through a pore

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.448
in the cell membrane

00:00:26.592 --> 00:00:29.120
and binds with an estrogen receptor.

00:00:29.784 --> 00:00:31.976
The receptor-estrogen complex

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.384
enters the nucleus,

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.184
binds with DNA,

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.232
and creates messenger RNA

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.096
or MRNA.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.248
MRNA leaves the nucleus

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.472
and enters the endoplasmic reticulum,

00:00:44.568 --> 00:00:46.928
where it creates a specific protein.

00:00:47.536 --> 00:00:49.256
Proteins are involved in all

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.168
processes within the body.

00:00:52.464 --> 00:00:55.400
When estrogen levels fall during menopause,

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.616
fewer of certain proteins are made

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.064
which causes changes in how

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.472
the body functions.

00:01:01.016 --> 00:01:02.752
One of the effects is to change

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.448
the hypothalamic thermostat

00:01:04.536 --> 00:01:07.304
that controls how you perceive hot and cold.

00:01:08.024 --> 00:01:09.912
A room that used to feel normal

00:01:09.936 --> 00:01:11.400
now feels hot.

00:01:12.136 --> 00:01:13.992
Your body’s response to heat

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.312
is to trigger sweating

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.608
and dilates skin’s surface vessels

00:01:17.752 --> 00:01:19.296
causing flushing of the skin,

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.384
called a hot flash.
