00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960
Breast cancer affects thousands of women each year.

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.496
These women face many treatment decisions,

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.400
including surgery to remove cancerous tissue.

00:00:08.648 --> 00:00:10.688
An important part of this discussion

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.344
is the possibility of breast reconstruction.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.320
Many women are candidates for

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.224
breast reconstruction after one

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.088
or both breasts have been removed;

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.672
however, most don’t receive information

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.704
about reconstruction options when making

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.920
treatment decisions at diagnosis. 

00:00:26.184 --> 00:00:28.664
Breast reconstruction can either be immediate

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.360
performed at the same time as mastectomy,

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.224
or delayed—performed at a later date post-mastectomy.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.784
There are different techniques,

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.232
approaches, and stages for each.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.032
The process typically involves two stages: 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.880
placement of a tissue expander

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.648
and then placement of a long-term implant. 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.464
For immediate reconstruction,

00:00:48.504 --> 00:00:51.888
the expander is placed at the time of mastectomy.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.720
For delayed reconstruction,

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.536
an incision is made using the

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.168
original mastectomy incision

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.096
and the tissue expander is inserted

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:00.800
and properly positioned.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.088
The expander is like a balloon.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.616
At regular intervals

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.488
over the next 4- 6 months,

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.944
the plastic surgeon injects saline into it

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.256
to stretch the skin

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.816
and help keep scar tissue from forming.

00:01:13.008 --> 00:01:14.920
When enough tissue has stretched,

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.808
the expander is replaced with a long term implant

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.272
filled with saline or silicone gel.

00:01:20.504 --> 00:01:23.320
The nipple and areola can be reconstructed

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.680
after the breast has healed using various techniques.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.248
In addition, tattooing of the areola

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.392
may be done to match the other breast.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.920
Optimal patient outcomes depend on many factors.

00:01:35.048 --> 00:01:36.480
Speak to your doctor about

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.304
breast reconstruction early.

00:01:38.392 --> 00:01:41.176
He or she can point you in the right direction

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.120
and help you find a plastic surgeon

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.664
that’s right for you.
