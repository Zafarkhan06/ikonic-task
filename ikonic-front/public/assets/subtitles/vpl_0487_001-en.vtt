00:00:00.384 --> 00:00:02.528
At their most basic level,

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.624
moisturizers reduce evaporation of water

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.912
from the outermost layers of skin,

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.720
which helps it to stay soft and pliable.

00:00:10.816 --> 00:00:12.344
Some moisturizers contain

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.488
substances known as humectants,

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.688
which attract water from the air

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.160
rather than simply holding

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.064
onto water already present on the skin.

00:00:21.232 --> 00:00:24.552
Moisturizers also typically contain emollients,

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.936
which soften and smooth the skin

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.080
by filling in spaces between skin cells.

00:00:30.272 --> 00:00:32.848
In addition to humectants and emollients,

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.408
many moisturizers contain sunscreen,

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.056
vitamins, and other complex mixtures of

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.912
agents designed to provide various benefits,

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.568
such as increased turnover of skin cells

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.768
and increased production of collagen and elastin.
