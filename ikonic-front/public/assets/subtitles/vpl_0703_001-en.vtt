00:00:00.512 --> 00:00:02.880
Intestinal obstruction is blockage

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.368
of your small intestine or colon.

00:00:05.496 --> 00:00:07.416
Your small intestine is the part of your

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.960
digestive tract following your stomach.

00:00:10.208 --> 00:00:12.104
After partially digested food

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.336
moves from your stomach

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.088
into your small intestine,

00:00:15.192 --> 00:00:17.304
wave-like contractions move it

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.176
through to your large intestine or colon.

00:00:20.616 --> 00:00:22.952
Sometimes the intestines become blocked

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.728
by strand-like bands of tissue called adhesions.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.800
These are internal scars

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.864
that form between 2 surfaces

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.320
of the body so they stick together.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.320
Abdominal hysterectomy or other abdominal surgeries

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.344
are a frequent cause of adhesions

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.152
leading to obstruction of the intestines.

00:00:42.368 --> 00:00:45.408
When the scar tissue grows over the intestine,

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.720
it can block the movement of digested

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.136
food through the digestive tract.

00:00:50.256 --> 00:00:52.272
The bowel above the obstruction

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.384
dilates, or gets wider.

00:00:54.536 --> 00:00:57.288
This causes collection of excess fluid

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.720
and impairs the flow of blood through the veins

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.384
and arteries in the walls of the intestine.

00:01:02.576 --> 00:01:06.128
Without a blood supply, the tissue slowly dies.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.712
Ultimately, the wall of dead intestinal

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.232
tissue can tear open,

00:01:10.296 --> 00:01:13.584
spilling its contents into the abdominal cavity.
