00:00:00.152 --> 00:00:02.176
Glucose is a form of sugar,

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:04.832
formed from the breakdown of foods we eat,

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.984
especially carbohydrates.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.688
Whenever you eat, the level of glucose

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.408
in your blood rises.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.288
People with diabetes have

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.216
too much glucose—sugar—in their blood.

00:00:16.376 --> 00:00:18.128
This occurs because of problems

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.544
with a hormone called insulin.

00:00:20.712 --> 00:00:23.416
Insulin allows glucose to move from the

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.552
bloodstream into cells for use as fuel.

00:00:26.688 --> 00:00:29.968
Insulin is produced by cells in your pancreas.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.896
This gland, which is located in your abdomen,

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.864
has patches of tissue called islets of Langerhans.

00:00:37.104 --> 00:00:40.464
The majority of islet cells are beta cells,

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.464
which normally produce, store, and release 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.816
small granules of insulin into your bloodstream.

00:00:47.032 --> 00:00:50.024
The insulin binds to receptors on the membrane

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.424
of most of the cells in your body.

00:00:52.568 --> 00:00:56.128
This activates protein molecules on the membrane

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.880
that allow the glucose to enter the cell. 

00:00:58.968 --> 00:01:01.536
Normally, the beta cells release

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.208
small amounts of insulin continuously

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.832
and also release insulin in surges

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.456
when blood glucose levels increase. 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.952
In people with type 1 diabetes,

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.312
no insulin is produced in response

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.176
to blood glucose levels.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.192
People with type 2 diabetes

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:19.640
produce insulin

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.096
but their bodies don’t use it properly.

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:25.232
High blood sugar—called hyperglycemia,

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.480
for an extended period of time

00:01:27.512 --> 00:01:31.680
can damage the kidneys, nerves, heart, and eyes.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.736
Very high blood sugar is a medical emergency.
