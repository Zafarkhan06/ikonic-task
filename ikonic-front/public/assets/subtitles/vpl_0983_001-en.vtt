00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.160
Bisphosphonates help build stronger bones

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.060
and reverse the effects of bone loss.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.500
The body normally manages the rate

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.760
bone is formed and broken down,

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.060
through two types of cells.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:17.060
Osteoclasts break down or reabsorb bone,

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.440
and Osteoblasts build up new bone.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.560
If Osteoblasts cannot rebuild bone faster than it is broken down,

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.300
this can result in weak or thinning bones

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.320
which are more likely to fracture or break.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.400
Bisphosphonates help by slowing down the bone reabsorption process

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.180
by blocking the target site on bone cells

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.500
that are selected for reabsorption.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.780
When Osteoclasts attempt to stick to the bone cells to reabsorb the bone

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.220
bisphosphonates prevent the Osteoclasts from sticking to the bone surface

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.340
and creating the ruffled border,

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.260
the seal between the Osteoclast and bone,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.060
so bone cannot be reabsorbed.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.240
This results in the bone maintaining its strength and density.
