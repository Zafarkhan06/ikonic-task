00:00:00.136 --> 00:00:02.240
Hypertensive nephrosclerosis

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.080
is damage to the kidneys resulting

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.016
from chronic high blood pressure.

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:08.600
High blood pressure makes the heart work harder

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.896
and can damage blood vessels and organs throughout your body.

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:14.576
It is one of the main causes of kidney failure.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.992
Each of your kidneys contains about a million

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.864
tiny filtering units called nephrons.

00:00:20.032 --> 00:00:22.896
They filter waste and extra fluid from your body.

00:00:23.024 --> 00:00:24.680
High blood pressure can damage

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.352
the smallest arteries in the nephrons, called arterioles,

00:00:28.592 --> 00:00:30.592
so that they are unable to provide enough

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.824
oxygen to the kidney tissues.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.320
Lack of oxygen results in cell death

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.512
and ultimately, kidney failure.
