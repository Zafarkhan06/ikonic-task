00:00:03.008 --> 00:00:04.456
Measure your waist:

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:06.024
Stand in front of a mirror

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:07.664
and identify the narrowest

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.048
part of your torso,

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.944
usually around the same level

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.176
as your belly button.

00:00:12.648 --> 00:00:14.384
Using a soft tape measure,

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.296
circle it around your abdomen.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:17.600
Stand up straight,

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.368
and exhale gently as you

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.096
pull the tape so that it stays

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.744
taut against your body,

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.200
but make sure it is not

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.088
squeezing into your skin.

00:00:26.512 --> 00:00:27.936
Look at the number at the point

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.544
where the zero end of the tape

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.464
intersects around your waist.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.776
This is your waist measurement.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.696
A waist size of greater

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:36.864
than 40 inches,

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.392
or 102 centimeters for men,

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.592
and a waist size of

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.528
greater than 35 inches,

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.816
or 88 centimeters for women,

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.008
is considered high risk.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.032
A high number may indicate

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.376
that you have excess fat

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.336
in your abdominal area.
