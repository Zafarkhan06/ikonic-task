00:00:00.208 --> 00:00:01.816
Anthrax are bacteria

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:03.056
that live in the soil.

00:00:03.144 --> 00:00:04.448
They form spores,

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.640
which can be inactive

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.152
for a long time.

00:00:07.312 --> 00:00:08.528
When active,

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.080
anthrax form new bacteria.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.968
Naturally occurring anthrax infections

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.112
usually begin when the bacteria

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:17.944
enter through a cut or scrape.

00:00:18.152 --> 00:00:20.208
A raised itchy bump develops,

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.232
which looks like an insect bite.

00:00:22.296 --> 00:00:23.648
After a day or two,

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.064
a blister forms.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.256
This is followed by a

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.936
painless open sore,

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.512
which is usually 1 to 3 cm

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.632
or roughly an inch

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.288
or smaller in diameter,

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.368
with a black area in the center.

00:00:35.456 --> 00:00:37.312
Antibiotics are used to treat

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.504
anthrax infections of the skin.
