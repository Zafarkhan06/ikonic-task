00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.808
The process of male erection

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.480
begins with stimulation

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.096
visual, psychological, or physical.

00:00:06.184 --> 00:00:07.448
When the brain perceives

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.896
stimulation and excitement,

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:11.328
it sends signals down the spinal cord.

00:00:11.496 --> 00:00:13.560
The signals travel to nerve endings

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.552
in two spongy tubes in the penis

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.440
called the corpora cavernosa.

00:00:17.528 --> 00:00:19.504
The nerve endings release the chemical

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.184
compound nitric oxide

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.592
into blood vessels of the

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.304
corpora cavernosa and surrounding tissues.

00:00:25.432 --> 00:00:27.808
The nitric oxide stimulates production

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.832
of cyclic guanosine monosulphate,

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.320
or cGMP.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.712
cGMP causes smooth muscles

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.416
in the walls of arteries bringing

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.552
blood into the penis to relax.

00:00:37.728 --> 00:00:39.944
When the walls of the arteries relax,

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.392
blood flow into the corpora cavernosa increases.

00:00:43.568 --> 00:00:45.952
At the same time, the walls of the veins

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.432
carrying blood out of the penis contract,

00:00:48.432 --> 00:00:50.430
so blood cannot flow out.

00:00:50.584 --> 00:00:52.800
As the arteries become full of blood,

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.056
the penis becomes longer and harder,

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.568
producing an erection.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.192
The erection is maintained

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.744
as long as the nerve endings in the

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.712
corpora cavernosa receive signals

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:02.616
from the brain.

00:01:02.744 --> 00:01:04.944
When the brain is no longer stimulated,

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.544
an enzyme called phosphodiesterase

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.192
or PDE5 is released.

00:01:10.336 --> 00:01:12.616
PDE5 causes the breakdown of

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:13.904
cGMP.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.024
The smooth muscles in the artery walls

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.376
contract, stopping the flow of blood into the penis.

00:01:19.568 --> 00:01:21.370
And the walls of the veins relax,

00:01:21.384 --> 00:01:23.072
so blood can flow out.
