00:00:00.256 --> 00:00:02.080
A womanâ€™s uterus is lined with

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:03.936
endometrial cells.

00:00:04.144 --> 00:00:05.832
In endometriosis,

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.448
dislocated cells called implants

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.584
grow on organ tissues located

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.288
outside the uterus.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.056
The most common sites are the ovaries,

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:16.352
Fallopian tubes,

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.952
and other areas in the pelvic cavity.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.488
Occasionally they move beyond the pelvic region.

00:00:22.792 --> 00:00:25.152
Like the cells inside the uterus,

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.656
dislocated endometrial cells are

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.080
influenced by female hormones.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.256
The tissue lining the uterus

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.488
thickens each month in preparation for pregnancy.

00:00:35.488 --> 00:00:37.480
If no egg is implanted,

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.168
the tissue is shed through menstruation.

00:00:40.472 --> 00:00:43.008
Along with the tissue inside the uterus,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.384
the implants also become thicker,

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.256
break down, and bleed.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.520
But there is no way to get rid of the excess tissue.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.200
Scar tissue and adhesions can form

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.616
that distort the normal anatomy.

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.400
Pelvic pain and bleeding are the most

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.040
common symptoms of endometriosis.

00:01:01.128 --> 00:01:02.696
Some women also have more

00:01:02.696 --> 00:01:04.664
difficulty becoming pregnant.

00:01:05.048 --> 00:01:07.712
Although the exact cause is unknown,

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.936
anatomical changes or problems

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.800
related to hormone production

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.288
may be responsible.

00:01:13.496 --> 00:01:14.896
Whatever the cause,

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.880
it is believed to be worsened by estrogen.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.584
Oral contraceptives and hormone therapy

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.680
can help control pain and shrink implants.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.096
Implants and scar tissue may require

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.456
surgical removal,

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.792
in a surgical procedure, termed laparoscopy.
