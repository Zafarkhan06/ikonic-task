00:00:00.224 --> 00:00:02.432
One way to categorize viruses

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:04.320
is how they reproduce.

00:00:04.448 --> 00:00:07.736
Retroviruses contain a strand or strands

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.088
of viral RNA as their genetic material

00:00:11.256 --> 00:00:15.168
and an enzyme called reverse transcriptase. 

00:00:15.504 --> 00:00:17.640
After the virus infects a cell,

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.288
this enzyme is used to make copies

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.688
of viral DNA from viral RNA. 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.392
Double strand copies of viral DNA

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.488
are inserted into the nucleus of the host cell.

00:00:29.704 --> 00:00:32.784
Another viral enzyme, called integrase,

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.792
inserts the viral DNA into the host cell DNA

00:00:36.952 --> 00:00:40.416
so that when the host cell reproduces its own DNA,

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.544
the viral DNA is also reproduced.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.296
Through a process called transcription,

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.304
the DNA sequence is used to reproduce

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.704
an equivalent copy of viral RNA. 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.680
These RNA strands are templates

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.360
for making new copies of RNA

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.800
and are also used for making viral proteins.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.392
The new virus particles are assembled,

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.256
and bud and release from the host cell membrane.
