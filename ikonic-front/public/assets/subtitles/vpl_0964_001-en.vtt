00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.800
Statins are a group of drugs that lower cholesterol levels.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.180
Both good and bad cholesterol are produced in your liver.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.220
Bad cholesterol, also called LDL,

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.520
is made by combining fats with proteins.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.600
an enzyme called, HMG-CoA reductase makes this happen.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.620
Although cholesterol is required for normal body functions,

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:29.820
too much LDL causes arteries to narrow by forming plaque.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.520
Statins work by blocking the enzyme that makes LDL cholesterol.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.100
By reducing bad cholesterol,

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.860
there is a lower risk for plaque build up.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.780
This leads to fewer heart attacks, strokes and other health problems.
