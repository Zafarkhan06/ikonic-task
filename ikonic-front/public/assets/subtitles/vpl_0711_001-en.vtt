00:00:00.248 --> 00:00:04.032
Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease.

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:06.264
If you have type 1 diabetes,

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.608
your immune system has destroyed the cells of your pancreas

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.312
that produce a hormone called insulin.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.200
Your pancreas is an organ located in your abdomen.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.760
Among its functions,

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.408
it produces different types of hormones.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.744
One of these is insulin.

00:00:23.944 --> 00:00:26.288
Insulin is produced in patches of tissue

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.680
called islets of Langerhans.

00:00:28.856 --> 00:00:31.872
The majority of islet cells are beta cells,

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:35.000
which normally produce, store, and release

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.328
small granules of insulin into your bloodstream.

00:00:38.824 --> 00:00:40.840
Insulin attaches to receptors

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.840
on cells throughout your body.

00:00:43.128 --> 00:00:44.736
This allows glucose

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.880
a form of sugar formed by breakdown of foods

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.712
to enter the cells to be used for fuel.

00:00:51.024 --> 00:00:53.008
In type 1 diabetes,

00:00:53.048 --> 00:00:55.312
the immune system mistakenly destroys

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.728
the beta cells that produce insulin.

00:00:58.152 --> 00:00:59.976
This means glucose cannot move

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.096
out of the bloodstream into cells

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.728
to be used for fuel.

00:01:04.472 --> 00:01:08.408
This extra sugar can damage your blood vessels and organs.
