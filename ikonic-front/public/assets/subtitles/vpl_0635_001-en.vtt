00:00:00.232 --> 00:00:02.000
A stroke is an interruption

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.840
of blood flow to the brain.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.264
Your blood, heart, and blood vessels

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.616
are the three main parts of your circulatory system.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.704
Your heart pumps your blood and

00:00:11.704 --> 00:00:13.700
keeps it moving throughout your body.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.376
Your blood travels through your blood vessels,

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.552
transporting nutrients and oxygen

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.936
to cells and removing waste.

00:00:21.056 --> 00:00:23.056
Sometimes a blood vessel develops

00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:26.568
a weakened, ballooning area called an aneurysm.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.032
This weakened area can burst.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.200
A hemorrhagic stroke occurs

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.880
when a weakened blood vessel in

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.672
part of your brain leaks or bursts.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.552
When the flow of blood and oxygen to the brain is

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.240
interrupted for longer than a few seconds,

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.184
brain cells can die.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.208
Brain cells can also be damaged

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.328
by bleeding into the brain.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.512
A stroke is an emergency

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.416
that requires immediate medical treatment.
