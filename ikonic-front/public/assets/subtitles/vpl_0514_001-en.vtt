00:00:00.568 --> 00:00:03.296
Your skin is composed of 3 layers.

00:00:03.464 --> 00:00:05.824
The outer layer, or epidermis,

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.864
is made up of cells called keratinocytes.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.168
They begin to form at the

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.128
bottom of the epidermis.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.952
They divide, pushing already-formed cells upwards.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.744
By the time the cells reach the skin’s surface,

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.400
they are no longer alive.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.912
These are the dead skin cells

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:23.352
we constantly shed.

00:00:23.648 --> 00:00:25.352
This process usually takes

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.896
about 30 days.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.912
In psoriasis, it takes only 3 to 4.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.736
And instead of falling off,

00:00:31.736 --> 00:00:33.730
the dead cells pile up.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.984
Psoriasis results from a problem

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.696
with a type of white blood cell

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.664
in the immune system called a T cell.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.544
T cells normally detect

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.832
and fight off foreign substances.

00:00:45.312 --> 00:00:46.616
In psoriasis,

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.256
T cells attack healthy skin cells

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.640
and trigger an immune response.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.232
Blood vessels in the skin get larger.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.224
Other white blood cells enter the epidermis.

00:00:57.576 --> 00:00:59.832
The T cells release messenger chemicals

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.312
called cytokines,

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.056
which tell the keratinocytes

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.496
to reproduce and mature

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:06.224
much faster than normal.

00:01:06.512 --> 00:01:08.080
New skin cells form

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.440
and move to the surface too quickly.

00:01:10.712 --> 00:01:12.304
They build up as the thick,

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.624
scaly patches on the skin’s surface

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.656
that characterize psoriasis.
