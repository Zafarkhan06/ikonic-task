00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.000
An umbilical hernia occurs when part of your intestines

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.140
pushes through an opening or weak spot

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.000
in your abdominal muscles near your belly button.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Umbilical hernias are very common

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.800
in newborns and infants,

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.340
but they can affect adults, too.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.800
Common symptoms for adults

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.120
with an umbilical hernia are:

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.680
A bulge in the abdomen near the belly button

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.900
that increases with coughing or straining.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.640
Pain or pressure at the hernia site.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.800
Increasing or sharp abdominal pain and vomiting

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.300
can be a sign of a strangulated hernia,

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.220
when the blood supply has been cut off

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.340
around the herniated intestine.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.220
This is a serious medical issue

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.380
and needs immediate attention.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.640
In adults, the most common causes

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.980
of umbilical hernias include: 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.460
Chronic straining or heavy lifting,

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.680
this increases pressure on the muscles in the abdomen.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.840
Being overweight or obese,

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.180
this also increases pressure on the muscles in the abdomen.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.620
Pregnancy, especially multiple pregnancies.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.440
Older age, the muscles often become weaker.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.420
In newborns and infants,

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.780
an umbilical hernia may be more obvious

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.380
when the infant cries,

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.260
causing the belly button to protrude, 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.560
or stick out.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.480
This is a classic sign of an umbillical hernia.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.020
When the developing fetus in the womb,

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.920
the umbilical cord passes through

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.120
an opening in the abdominal wall.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.880
This usually closes soon after birth.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.060
However, the muscles do not always seal completely,

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.820
leaving a weak spot through which an

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.120
umbilical hernia can push through.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.680
By age 2,

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.280
most umbilical hernias will have

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.760
closed on their own.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.720
Nearly all umbilical hernias

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.600
will have closed without surgery by age 5.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.020
In some cases,

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.300
surgery may be needed to

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.180
repair an umbilical hernia.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.180
Surgery is more common for adults with

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.740
an umbilical hernia.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.560
The surgery may be open or laparoscopic.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.160
If surgery is needed,

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.620
and incision, or several small incisions,

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.440
are made near the belly button.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.760
The loop of intestine is

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.880
placed back into the abdominal cavity,

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.880
and the incision closed.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.160
Sometimes a piece of mesh material is used

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.700
to help strengthen the area

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.400
where the muscles are repaired.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.580
Talk with your doctor

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.640
if you have a bulge near your navel.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.020
Seek emergency care

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.480
if the bulge becomes painful or tender.
