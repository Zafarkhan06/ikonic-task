00:00:00.528 --> 00:00:02.736
Narrowing of the carotid arteries,

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.568
which are in your neck and supply blood

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.736
to the head and neck,

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.192
may be treated with angioplasty. 

00:00:08.392 --> 00:00:10.296
A thin, flexible tube called a

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.496
balloon catheter

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.248
is inserted into the narrowed

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.728
or blocked artery.

00:00:14.984 --> 00:00:16.984
A balloon at the tip of the catheter

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.096
is inflated

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.600
which stretches the narrowed artery.

00:00:20.872 --> 00:00:22.192
The balloon is deflated

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.136
and withdrawn with the catheter.

00:00:24.336 --> 00:00:26.192
Sometimes a metal device

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.496
called a stent is left in the artery

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.384
to help keep the artery from narrowing again.
