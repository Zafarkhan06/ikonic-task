00:00:00.352 --> 00:00:04.528
The Achilles tendon, also known as the calcaneal tendon,

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.288
connects the calf muscles.

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:10.456
Including the gastrocnemius and soleus to the heel bone,

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.568
which is also known as the calcaneus.

00:00:13.976 --> 00:00:15.968
When the calf muscles flex,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.968
they pull on the Achilles tendon 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.232
and lift the heel off the ground.

00:00:20.432 --> 00:00:25.232
This action is especially important for sprinting and jumping.
