00:00:00.288 --> 00:00:03.600
Epstein-Barr Virus, or EBV for short,

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.312
is a member of the herpesvirus family.

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:08.040
Most people are infected with

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.960
EBV at some point.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.976
In childhood, these infections often cause no symptoms.

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.840
In adults, EBV has been implicated

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.144
in numerous autoimmune diseases and cancer.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.728
Up to half the EBV infections

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.448
that occur during adolescence or

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.416
early adulthood cause infectious mononucleosis,

00:00:28.416 --> 00:00:30.410
sometimes called mono.

00:00:30.664 --> 00:00:33.640
Mono is spread primarily through saliva.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.528
A person can also spread it

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.256
by coughing or sneezing,

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.384
spreading droplets of infected saliva or mucus,

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.288
which others can inhale.

00:00:42.448 --> 00:00:45.024
The virus enters cells in the area of the

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.584
upper throat that lies behind the nose,

00:00:47.584 --> 00:00:49.580
called the nasopharynx.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.608
It takes over the host cellâ€™s nuclear material

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.168
to replicate more viral particles.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.648
These particles are released and spread

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.248
to other parts of the body,

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.920
and into the bloodstream,

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.584
where they infect immune cells

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.680
called B-lymphocytes.

00:01:04.968 --> 00:01:06.872
Inside the B cells,

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.488
the viral genome changes shape.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.296
It persists in an inactive state

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.024
and is passed on to new B cells.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.272
It also protects the invaded cell

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.728
from chemicals released by T cells,

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.448
while healthy B cells are destroyed.
