00:00:00.296 --> 00:00:01.904
The normal hip joint is formed

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.984
by a ball at the top of the thighbone,

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.616
which fits into a socket in the hip bone.

00:00:07.048 --> 00:00:09.424
When checking your babyâ€™s legs and hips,

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.112
your healthcare provider may find

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:12.360
that the thigh bone does not

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.776
fit securely into the hip socket.

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:16.408
Loose or stretched ligaments

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.368
at the hip joint

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:18.456
can affect the normal

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.464
development of the hip socket.

00:00:20.792 --> 00:00:22.464
A child with this problem

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.752
known as developmental dysplasia

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:25.480
of the hip

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.640
may need to see a specialist.

00:00:28.032 --> 00:00:29.320
The hip joint will need to be

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.008
put back into the socket,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.616
and your child may need to wear

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.928
a brace or cast.

00:00:34.128 --> 00:00:36.432
Surgery is rarely needed.
