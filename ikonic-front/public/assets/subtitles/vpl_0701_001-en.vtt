00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.280
A man’s testicles serve as

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.984
 reproductive organs by producing sperm.

00:00:05.288 --> 00:00:07.816
They also produce testosterone

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.024
the principal male sex hormone. 

00:00:10.136 --> 00:00:12.352
Production of testosterone begins in a

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.136
part of the brain called the hypothalamus.

00:00:15.312 --> 00:00:19.016
It produces a hormone called GnRH,

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.232
which causes another part of the brain,

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:22.808
the pituitary gland,

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.312
to make two additional hormones.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:26.848
These two hormones travel

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.024
through the bloodstream to the testicles.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.040
One called FSH triggers sperm production.

00:00:33.344 --> 00:00:36.528
The other called LH triggers production of

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.344
testosterone by cells of the testes.

00:00:39.528 --> 00:00:42.264
Many men have testosterone deficiency.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:43.944
It can be primary

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.288
meaning the testes fail to respond to the brain hormones.

00:00:47.456 --> 00:00:49.856
Since testosterone levels remain low,

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.160
the brain keeps producing FSH and LH,

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.920
and blood levels of these hormones are high.

00:00:56.048 --> 00:00:57.920
It can also be secondary,

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.672
meaning the hypothalamus or pituitary

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.744
doesn’t produce enough FSH or LH.

00:01:03.976 --> 00:01:06.392
So testosterone levels are low,

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.592
while levels of FSH and LH are low

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.232
or mistakenly normal.

00:01:11.352 --> 00:01:14.000
Effects can include reduced energy,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.328
mood changes,

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.928
reduced muscle mass, 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.360
low sex drive,

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.064
and erectile dysfunction.

00:01:20.272 --> 00:01:23.272
There are many possible causes of low testosterone,

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.544
which is diagnosed with a blood test.

00:01:25.648 --> 00:01:27.928
Treatment depends on the cause.

00:01:28.024 --> 00:01:32.296
Options include testosterone replacement therapy via injection,

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.208
a testosterone patch,

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.264
and testosterone gel.
