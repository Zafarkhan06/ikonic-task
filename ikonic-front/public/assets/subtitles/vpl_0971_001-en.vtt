00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.940
Proton pump inhibitors or PPIs,

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.840
prevent the stomach from making stomach acid.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.400
Stomach cells contain hydrogen potassium ATPase,

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.540
a protein also called "the proton pump."

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.280
Food entering the stomach tells hydrogen potassium ATPase

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.160
to move from inside the cell to its surface

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.680
and pump acidic hydrogen ions into the stomach

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.360
in exchange for non-acidic potassium ions.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.060
As more hydrogen builds up in the stomach

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.200
it becomes more acidic.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.660
Although some acid is required for digestion and to kill bacteria,

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.680
high levels may cause indigestion and ulcers.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.180
PPIs work by blocking the proton pump in stomach cells

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.480
from moving to the cells surface.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.000
This prevents the pump from adding hydrogen to the stomach

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.560
which decreases the amount of acid in the stomach.
