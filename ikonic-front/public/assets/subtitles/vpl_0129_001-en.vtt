00:00:00.224 --> 00:00:02.456
If your child has a knee fracture,

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:04.432
it means there is a break or crack

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:05.368
in one of the bones

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:06.944
that make up the knee joint.

00:00:07.136 --> 00:00:08.344
These bones include the

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.192
upper leg bone or femur,

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.224
the bones in the lower leg bones

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:13.896
the tibia and fibula

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:15.304
and the kneecap.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.456
If the fracture is at the growth plate

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:18.944
near the ends of the bone,

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.400
bone growth can be affected and may require

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.920
special X-rays or other tests.

00:00:23.976 --> 00:00:25.712
Young bones are more flexible

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:26.536
than an adult’s,

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.280
so a child’s bone may crack

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.512
or just buckle without a clear break

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.008
instead of snapping like a dry stick.

00:00:33.296 --> 00:00:34.912
Surgery may be needed if the

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.392
broken bone is crooked;

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.800
wires, pins, screws,

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.584
metal plates or rods

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:41.944
may be used to hold the

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.640
straightened bones together.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.368
Treatment of a knee fracture may require

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.928
wearing a splint until swelling is reduced,

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.768
followed by a cast for 4 to 8 weeks.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.344
Your child may need to use

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.256
crutches for several weeks.
