00:00:00.184 --> 00:00:02.808
Normally, the small intestine and colon

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.264
absorb about 99% of the fluid

00:00:05.264 --> 00:00:07.260
from what you drink and eat.

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.352
What remains is stool that is secreted from your GI tract.

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:14.064
 If there is more water than can be absorbed,

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.432
or if absorption of water is reduced,

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.712
it can result in diarrhea.

00:00:19.008 --> 00:00:21.352
Infections are the most common cause of

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.232
what is called secretory diarrhea. 

00:00:24.472 --> 00:00:26.432
Bacteria in the gut invade

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.248
the lining of the small intestine

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.128
and produce toxins.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.152
The toxins cause secretion of

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.208
more water than can be absorbed,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.176
resulting in diarrhea.

00:00:36.352 --> 00:00:39.008
Bacteria can also cause what is known as

00:00:39.008 --> 00:00:41.000
inflammatory diarrhea.

00:00:41.224 --> 00:00:44.384
Absorption in the small intestine is maximized by

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.808
finger-shaped structures called villi,

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.416
which project from the wall of the gut.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.368
The villi can be damaged

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.728
by inflammation caused by bacteria,

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.248
and by your bodyâ€™s immune response.

00:00:56.424 --> 00:00:58.392
Destruction of the villi reduces 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.240
the amount of water absorbed,

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.240
which results in diarrhea.
