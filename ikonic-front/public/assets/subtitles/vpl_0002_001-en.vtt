00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.550
The back is an intricate structure of bones,

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:05.550
muscles, and other tissues

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.560
that forms the posterior part of the body’s trunk,

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.640
from the neck to the hipbones and pelvis.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.290
The bones that form the core of the back structure

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:16.650
are called the spine

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.140
or spinal column.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.540
This stack of more than 30 bones,

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:22.560
vertebrae,

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.600
supports the upper body’s weight

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.600
and houses the spinal cord.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.170
The nervous system structure

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.890
that carries signals which control

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.160
the body’s movements

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.240
and convey its sensations.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:35.610
Each of the bones that make up

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.830
the spinal column

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:38.480
has a hole in the center,

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.610
and when these bones are stacked,

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.750
it creates a channel that surrounds

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.750
and protects the spinal cord.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:46.950
The bones or vertebrae

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.700
that make up the spinal column

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.050
are not stacked directly on top of each other.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.900
There are spaces between them

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.560
that are maintained by round,

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.070
spongy pads of cartilage

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.370
called intervertebral disks.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.230
Each intervertebral disk

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.230
is made up of two components,

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.020
the annulus fibrosus

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.100
and the nucleus pulposus.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.210
The annulus fibrosus

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.750
is the tough outer portion of the disk.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.490
The nucleus pulposus

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.210
is the inner gel material

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.980
surrounded by the annulus fibrosus.

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.560
These disks and the space

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.470
between the bones that they fill,

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.210
give the lower back flexibility.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.650
The disks act much like

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.040
shock absorbers throughout the spinal column

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.780
to cushion the bones as the body moves.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.410
Bands of tissues called ligaments and tendons

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.190
hold the vertebrae in place

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.060
and attach the muscles of the back

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.650
to the spinal column.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.070
Small nerves called roots

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.320
enter and emerge from the spinal cord

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.490
through spaces between the vertebrae.

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.420
The spine has four regions.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.950
Starting from the top,

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.440
there are seven cervical,

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.660
or neck, vertebrae,

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.810
labeled C1 through C7,

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.790
twelve thoracic or upper back vertebrae,

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.130
labeled T1 through T12,

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.090
five lumbar vertebrae,

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.750
designated L1 through L5 in the lower back,

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.730
and finally, the sacrum and coccyx,

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.310
a group of bones fused together at the base of the spine.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.740
Intervertebral disks are located

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.160
between each vertebra

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.510
from C2 through S1.
