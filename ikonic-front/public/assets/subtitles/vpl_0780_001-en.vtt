00:00:01.288 --> 00:00:03.320
Treatment of an ankle fracture is 

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.968
determined by the stability of the ankle.

00:00:06.088 --> 00:00:07.872
If the ankle is stable

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.176
a cast or brace may be used 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.992
in conjunction with crutches,

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.936
to immobilize and rest the ankle.

00:00:15.152 --> 00:00:17.280
If the ankle is not stable,

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.088
surgery will likely be recommended.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.440
Surgery usually involves using

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.712
screws and plates to realign the bone fragments

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.304
back to their natural positions.
