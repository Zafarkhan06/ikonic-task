00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.880
A colonoscopy is a procedure that your doctor

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.464
may perform to examine the inner lining

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.112
of your large intestine, or colon.

00:00:09.392 --> 00:00:11.520
A colonscopy helps your doctor

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.584
diagnose intestinal diseases

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.704
like colitis, colon polyps, or colon cancer.

00:00:18.344 --> 00:00:20.312
Before the colonoscopy,

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.048
you will need to “prep” or clean your colon.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.472
Colon prep is an important step

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.496
to make sure your doctor can see

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.160
the inside of your colon.

00:00:29.272 --> 00:00:32.032
There are several methods of colon prep.

00:00:32.208 --> 00:00:35.976
The most common involves drinking a cleansing solution.

00:00:36.176 --> 00:00:38.040
Your doctor will prescribe the

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.352
the best method for you

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.784
and
give you detailed instructions.

00:00:42.216 --> 00:00:44.104
The colonoscopy procedure

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.880
typically lasts 20 to 30 minutes

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.224
and you will be sedated.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.360
You may feel some slight pressure

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.824
but you should not experience any pain.

00:00:53.544 --> 00:00:55.496
To begin, you will be asked

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.088
to lie comfortably on your left side.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.904
Your doctor may instruct you to

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.408
pull your knees into your chest.

00:01:02.488 --> 00:01:04.464
Your doctor will then insert

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.952
a thin, flexible tube called a colonoscope

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.504
through your rectum into your colon.

00:01:10.776 --> 00:01:12.552
The colonoscope has a light

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.568
and a small camera on the end

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.088
so your doctor can see the

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.600
inside of your colon.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.584
Your doctor may also use the

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.512
colonoscope to expand your colon with air

00:01:22.512 --> 00:01:24.510
or clean areas with water

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.032
to make the lining easier to see.

00:01:27.368 --> 00:01:28.816
During the procedure,

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.984
the colonoscope can be used to collect

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.656
tissue samples called a biopsy

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.008
or to remove an abnormal growth,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.440
such as a polyp or lesion.

00:01:39.168 --> 00:01:40.760
After the procedure,

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.952
you will lie down until the sedation wears off.

00:01:44.008 --> 00:01:46.856
You won't be able to drive for the rest of the day,

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.368
So plan to have someone take you home.

00:01:49.504 --> 00:01:51.336
Your doctor will contact you with

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.672
the results of your colonoscopy.
