00:00:00.208 --> 00:00:02.664
Nursemaid's elbow and pulled elbow

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:03.840
are common names for

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.224
subluxation of the radial head.

00:00:06.384 --> 00:00:08.080
They all refer to an injury

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.344
to the ligament that keeps

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:10.992
the radius and ulna

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:12.792
the two bones of the lower arm

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:13.880
in place.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.600
Most of the children who get

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.264
this injury are 3 years or younger.

00:00:18.448 --> 00:00:20.432
The injury occurs when a strong

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.264
force is exerted on the elbow,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.936
such as an adult pulling on the

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.880
child's hand or forearm,

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.536
or the child falling away

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.600
while an adult holds his arm.

00:00:29.848 --> 00:00:31.392
To treat the injury,

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.472
your childâ€™s healthcare provider moves

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.096
the bone and ligament back

00:00:35.112 --> 00:00:36.960
to their correct positions.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.960
Your child can usually begin to use

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.576
his arm again within a few minutes

00:00:40.576 --> 00:00:42.040
after being treated.
