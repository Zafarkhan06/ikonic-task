00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.240
The mitral valve controls the flow of blood

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.580
from the left atrium of the heart to the left ventricle.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.400
There are different types of mitral valve disease.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.200
Mitral valve prolapse is a condition in which

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.040
the mitral valve leaflets are floppy or loose

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.880
and donâ€™t close tightly.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.020
This causes blood to leak backward

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.660
into the left atrium.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.400
Mitral valve stenosis is a condition in which

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.540
the leaflets become thick or stiff

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.400
causing a narrowed valve opening

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.120
and reduced blood flow through the valve.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.300
Treatment for mitral valve disease

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.440
depends on several factors including

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.040
how severe your condition is

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.000
and if you are experiencing signs and symptoms.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.620
Your doctor may recommend

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.700
mitral valve repair or mitral valve replacement.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.040
Several surgical procedures exist

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.340
to repair or replace mitral valves,

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.180
including open-heart surgery,

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.880
which involves a cut in the center of the chest,

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.540
or by using minimally invasive methods,

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.680
which involve smaller incisions in the chest.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.040
Mitral valve repair preserves your mitral valve.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.040
Two leaflets make up the mitral valve,

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.480
the anterior leaflet and the posterior leaflet.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.040
Repairing the valve depends on your specific condition.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.280
To repair the valve your doctor may

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.380
remove a piece from the mitral valve.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.180
and suture together the edges

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.280
or replace the cords on the unsupported free edge

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.500
of the leaflet to repair the support for the valve.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.660
Or your doctor may need to separate

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.040
valve leaflets that have fused together.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.780
Typically, a supportive ring is also placed

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.760
around the valve to complete the repair.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.700
If your mitral valve cannot be repaired,

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.160
your doctor may recommend mitral valve replacement.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.540
During the prodedure,

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.920
your doctor will remove the damaged valve

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.840
and replace it with a tissue or mechanical valve.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.840
What type of valve is used

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.440
will depend on your age, your disease,

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.200
and your willingness to take anticoagulation medicines.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.740
Tissue valves come from a pig, from a cow, or from a human.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.680
These valves are very similar to your own valve

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.300
and because your own body accepts them well,

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.080
you will not require long term blood-thinning medication.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.580
The disadvantage of tissue valves, however,

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.120
is that they are less durable

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.040
than either our own valves or mechanical valves.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.000
Mechanical valves are more durable

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.280
but are not natural,

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.700
and they may cause blood clots to form.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.480
Because of that possibility,

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.260
people who have mechanical valves

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.060
require blood-thinning medication

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.860
for the rest of their lives to prevent blood clots.
