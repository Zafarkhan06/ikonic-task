00:00:00.296 --> 00:00:02.416
If your child has a fractured elbow,

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:03.696
or olecranon,

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:05.776
it means there is a crack or break

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:06.792
in the bony tip

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:08.592
directly under the skin.

00:00:08.856 --> 00:00:11.280
The most common cause is a fall

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.488
or a direct blow to the elbow.

00:00:13.608 --> 00:00:15.552
If the fracture is at the growth plate

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.080
near the ends of the bone,

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.920
bone growth can be affected

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.304
and may require special

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.304
X-rays or other tests.

00:00:22.504 --> 00:00:24.424
Young bones are more flexible

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.408
than an adult’s,

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.072
so a child’s bone may crack

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.120
or buckle without a clear break

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.728
instead of snapping like a dry stick.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.952
If the joint is dislocated,

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.848
it will have to be put back into alignment.

00:00:36.864 --> 00:00:39.488
Surgery may be needed to repair the bone

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.456
if a larger part is broken

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.048
or the break is in the joint itself.

00:00:44.352 --> 00:00:45.976
Depending on the injury,

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.912
a fractured elbow may be treated with

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.880
casts or splints for 4 to 8 weeks.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.640
Your child will also be given

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.672
a sling to support the elbow.
