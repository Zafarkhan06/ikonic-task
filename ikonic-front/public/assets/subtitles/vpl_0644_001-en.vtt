00:00:00.256 --> 00:00:02.328
The flow of blood inside the heart 

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.384
is controlled by four thin, flexible valves

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.912
that open and close with each heartbeat.

00:00:08.016 --> 00:00:10.048
They are the tricuspid valve,

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.512
the pulmonic valve,

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:12.816
the mitral valve,

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.344
and the aortic valve.
