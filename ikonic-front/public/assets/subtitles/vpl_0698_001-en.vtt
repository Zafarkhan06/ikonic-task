00:00:00.488 --> 00:00:04.048
In peripheral artery disease, or PAD,

00:00:04.472 --> 00:00:06.624
fatty material called plaque

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.056
builds up inside the arteries that supply

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:11.272
blood and oxygen to your legs.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.048
The plaque can reduce the blood flow,

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.992
so the muscle cells in your legs

00:00:15.992 --> 00:00:17.808
donâ€™t get the oxygen they need,

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.888
causing pain and cramps.

00:00:20.248 --> 00:00:22.432
Diagnosis of PAD starts

00:00:22.432 --> 00:00:24.430
with a physical examination.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.024
Your doctor can check for a

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.576
weak pulse in your legs,

00:00:27.712 --> 00:00:30.120
and whooshing sounds called bruits,

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.648
which are heard when they listen to blood flow.

00:00:32.976 --> 00:00:34.464
Your doctor may recommend

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.144
an ankle-brachial index, or ABI.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.848
An ABI compares

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.888
the blood pressure in your ankles and arms.

00:00:43.056 --> 00:00:46.664
An ABI is done with a regular blood pressure cuff.

00:00:46.864 --> 00:00:50.296
A handheld ultrasound device called a Doppler

00:00:50.408 --> 00:00:52.752
lets your doctor listen to blood flow.

00:00:53.272 --> 00:00:57.032
Normally, the pressure in the ankle is the same or higher

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.560
than the pressure in the arm,

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.968
and the index is around 1.

00:01:01.056 --> 00:01:03.480
As PAD becomes more severe,

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.024
the index number becomes smaller.

00:01:06.128 --> 00:01:09.360
ABI may be done if you have symptoms of PAD

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.864
like leg pain brought on by walking.

00:01:12.224 --> 00:01:15.512
But since PAD often causes no symptoms,

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.856
ask your doctor about ABI

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.864
if you are over 50 and have risk factors,

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.368
which include smoking,

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.672
diabetes,

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.840
overweight,

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.208
high blood pressure

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.728
or high cholesterol.

00:01:28.128 --> 00:01:29.792
Your doctor may also recommend

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.568
other tests for PAD.

00:01:31.768 --> 00:01:33.632
These can include imaging tests

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.440
such as an ultrasound, MRI, or a CT scan

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.440
of the arteries in your legs.
