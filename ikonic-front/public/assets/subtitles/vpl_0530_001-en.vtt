00:00:00.232 --> 00:00:02.400
Facial transplant is a very

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.248
new surgical procedure.

00:00:04.376 --> 00:00:06.088
It was first done in the US

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.840
on a man who lost the central

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.176
portion of his face

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.080
including his nose, lips,

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.408
and underlying bone

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.040
after suffering severe burns from an electrified rail.

00:00:16.368 --> 00:00:18.872
The entire center portion of the face,

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.224
including the skin from cheek to cheek,

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.248
and all the underlying bones,

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.824
blood vessels, muscles, and nerves

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.760
were removed from the donor,

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.576
who had died during heart transplant surgery,

00:00:30.632 --> 00:00:32.472
and transplanted to the recipient

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.840
during a 17 hour procedure.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.272
As more of these surgeries are performed,

00:00:37.272 --> 00:00:39.270
they offer new hope to those whose

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.104
injuries cannot be repaired

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.224
with conventional plastic surgery.
