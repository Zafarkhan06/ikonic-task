00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:10.100
Mitral regurgitation occurs when a diseased mitral valve leaks

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.340
or allows blood to flow backward

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.220
into the heart and congest the lungs.

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.940
Severe mitral regurgitation can cause

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.260
shortness of breath,

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.300
fatigue,

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.300
heart failure

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.620
and lead to an irregular heart rhythm

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.340
called atrial fibrillation.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.260
Treating severe mitral regurgitation

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.540
usually involves open-heart surgery

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.980
to repair or replace the valve.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.980
However, surgical repair or replacement

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.100
may be too high risk in some patients.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.320
Less invasive procedures such as

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.560
transcatheter mitral valve repair

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.460
may be considered in this situation.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.580
Transcatheter mitral valve repair

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.120
is an edge-to-edge repair of the mitral valve leaflets

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.720
that is completed within 2-3 hours

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.060
under general anesthesia.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.100
Patients are completely asleep

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.300
with a breathing tube to keep them comfortable.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.960
Transesophageal echocardiography

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.000
is utilized to help ensure successful placement of the device.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.340
With the mitral repair procedure

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.920
a small puncture or incision is made in your groin

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.480
and the clips are delivered through a catheter

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.120
and are attached to the mitral valve leaflets.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.480
Pulling them together

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.980
so the valve can close properly.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.000
The clips are metal covered in fabric.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.900
They become a permanent part of your heart.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.140
After the procedure,

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.860
Patients can usually go home the same day

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.860
or the following day.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.700
You will be ready for discharge

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.600
when your blood pressure and heart rhythm are stable,

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.160
you can get out of bed with minimal assistance,

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.160
and your groin sites are stable.
