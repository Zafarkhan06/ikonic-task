00:00:00.168 --> 00:00:02.568
Glaucoma is a group of eye conditions

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.192
in which high pressure inside your eye

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.040
damages the optic nerve,

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.176
which transmits visual information to the brain.

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.592
The eyeâ€™s inner pressure

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.928
depends on the amount of fluid in the eye.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.824
Increased intraocular pressure in glaucoma

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.064
usually results from a build up of fluid

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.688
called aqueous humor.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.864
Normally, production and removal

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.784
of this fluid is in balance.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.744
It is produced by ciliary bodies

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.240
in the area behind the iris

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.344
called the posterior chamber.

00:00:30.552 --> 00:00:33.024
It flows up the back side of the iris,

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.088
out of the pupil,

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.088
into the area in front of the iris,

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.976
called the anterior chamber.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.928
It leaves the eye at the angle

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.872
where the iris and cornea meet,

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.632
flowing through spongy tissue

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.464
called the trabecular network

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.600
into a channel that is part of the venous bloodstream.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.072
In closed-angle glaucoma,

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.000
the iris bulges forward

00:00:53.024 --> 00:00:55.800
and blocks the fluid from reaching the network.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.248
The fluid builds up

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.568
and intraocular pressure increases,

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.112
usually suddenly.

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.288
In open-angle glaucoma,

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.872
the trabecular network is partially blocked

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.320
so the fluid drains out too slowly.

00:01:08.488 --> 00:01:10.016
As fluid backs up,

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.672
pressure in the eye slowly increases.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.936
There may be substantial vision loss

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.960
before the problem is identified.
