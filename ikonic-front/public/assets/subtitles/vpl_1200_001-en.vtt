00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.940
The hip is a ball and socket joint.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.880
The socket is part of your pelvis, or hip bone.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.820
The ball is located at the top

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.820
of your femur, or thighbone.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.400
Both are covered with a layer of smooth cartilage

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.960
that cushions and protects your bones when you move.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.920
A total hip replacement, or arthroplasty,

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.920
is a surgical procedure to remove damaged portions

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.840
of your hip joint and replace them

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.920
with plastic and metal implants.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.380
To begin the procedure,

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.140
your surgeon will make an incision

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.480
over the front or side of your hip

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.460
then smooth and reshape the socket.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.400
Your surgeon will place a metal cup

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.860
into the prepared socket of the hip joint.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.360
The cup may be attached with surgical cement

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.840
or the outside of the cup may be rough to help

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.820
bone grow
into its surface to lock it in place.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.160
Sometimes surgeons use a combination

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.140
of glue and a rough cup.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.740
The cup has a plastic or ceramic liner

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.320
that works like cartilage as you move.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.640
Your surgeon will remove the damaged

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.520
ball-shaped head of your femur, or thighbone,

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.520
and implant a metal stem.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.980
Your surgeon will then attach a metal ball

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.980
to the stem which fits into the cup in the pelvis.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.320
Together, these components replace

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.960
your ball and socket joint.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.180
Like all surgeries,

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.480
risks and complications are possible.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.660
Your surgeon will explain these to you.
