00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.580
Serotonin is a chemical messenger nerve cells use to communicate.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.380
Changing the levels of chemical messengers

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:14.100
helps control pain, pleasure, anxiety, sleep and emotional behaviors.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.040
Serotonin passes from cell to cell

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.720
by binding to receptors on nearby cells to deliver messages.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.940
Nerve cells control the amount of serotonin traveling between the cells.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:32.440
Serotonin is recycled by the cells in a process called "reuptake."

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:37.600
Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors or SSRIs,

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.160
affect serotonin levels used to communicate between nerve cells

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.680
by preventing the cells from recycling serotonin

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.920
and allowing it more time to relay the message.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.920
Changing the balance of serotonin in the brain

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.900
seems to help nerve cells send and receive

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.800
chemical messages which in turn boosts mood.
