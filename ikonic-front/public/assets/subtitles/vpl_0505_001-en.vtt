00:00:00.136 --> 00:00:02.544
Bare feet are exposed to microscopic

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:04.168
organisms that live in warm,

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.544
moist environments, like showers.

00:00:06.696 --> 00:00:08.704
The organisms that usually cause

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.352
toenail fungal infections

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.168
are called dermatophytes.

00:00:12.408 --> 00:00:14.976
Fungal spores enter through tiny cuts

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:16.808
or work through small separations

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.920
between the nail and nail bed.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.064
They then bloom into tiny

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.128
fungal filaments or hypha

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.688
that destroy the nail from below.

00:00:25.928 --> 00:00:27.896
Fungal infections are more common

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.872
in toenails than fingernails,

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:32.264
possibly because the dark, moist environment

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.144
inside shoes helps fungus to grow.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.496
At first the infection may only

00:00:37.496 --> 00:00:39.490
cause a spot on the toenail.

00:00:39.624 --> 00:00:41.216
But over time it can cause

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.120
ugly scaling and cracking,

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.368
and painful splitting of the nail.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.328
Fungal infection of the toenails,

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.152
called onychomycosis,

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.568
can be treated with oral medications,

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.912
topical medications you apply to the infected nail,

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:56.936
antifungal nail lacquer,

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.568
and in extreme cases,

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.832
surgical removal of the nail.
