Crohn’s disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.320
that causes inflammation in your digestive tract.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.360
In Crohn’s disease any part of the digestive tract can be affected,

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.500
but it most commonly affects the end of the small intestine

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.640
and the beginning of the large intestine, or colon.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.080
Inflammation can be continuous or may be patchy.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.540
It often spreads into deeper layers of the bowel wall.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.760
Crohn’s disease can cause diarrhea,

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.820
abdominal pain, fatigue, weight loss and malnutrition.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.820
Symptoms vary between people.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.220
Some people may experience only mild or occasional symptoms

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.720
and for some it can be very painful

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.140
and sometimes may lead to life-threatening complications.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.320
There is no cure for Crohn’s disease

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.540
but treatment can reduce its signs and symptoms.
