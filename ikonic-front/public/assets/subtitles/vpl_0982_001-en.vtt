00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:06.500
Beta-lactam antibiotics treat a variety of bacterial infections.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.540
They prevent the growth of bacteria by damaging the cell wall,

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.800
bacteria's strongest protection from the environment.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.080
Bacteria are everywhere.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.160
Some can be good bacteria,

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.260
but infections can occur when large amounts of any type of bacteria

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.460
sneak past the body's natural defenses and multiply.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.740
Bacteria multiply by growing and splitting in half.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.420
One of the last steps in this process

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.660
is sealing off the opening in the cell wall.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.040
Beta-lactam antibiotics have a commonly shaped

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.220
structural piece called the Beta-lactam ring.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.920
Which allows these drugs to bind proteins

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.940
and in turn prevent the formation of a cell wall.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.020
Beta-lactam antibiotics attach to and inactivate

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.840
enzymes in the bacterial cell membrane.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.700
This interferes with how bacteria form their cell wall,

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.260
which stops bacteria from growing and multiplying.
