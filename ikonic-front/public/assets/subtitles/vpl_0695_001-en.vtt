00:00:00.128 --> 00:00:02.344
Gout is a form of arthritis,

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.032
which begins with the breakdown

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:07.328
and elimination of chemicals called purines.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.624
Purines are naturally occurring chemicals,

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.784
which are present in the genetic material

00:00:12.784 --> 00:00:14.780
of all the cells of your body.

00:00:14.888 --> 00:00:16.480
They are also found in the cells

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.192
of plants and animals.

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.440
The cells in your body are constantly

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.584
dying and being replaced.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.592
Part of this process is the breakdown

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.328
and elimination of the purines

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.024
that were in the cells.

00:00:28.592 --> 00:00:30.600
Your body also needs to break down

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.384
and eliminate purines from foods you eat.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.296
A small number of foods contain

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.496
high concentrations of purines.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.768
These include shellfish and organ meats

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.576
like liver and kidneys.

00:00:41.968 --> 00:00:47.456
Purines are broken down in several stages.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.976
chemical waste product called uric acid.

00:00:51.576 --> 00:00:53.968
Normally, uric acid travels through your

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.528
bloodstream to your kidneys,

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.848
to be eliminated in your urine.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.328
But if blood levels of uric acid are too high,

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.344
needle-like crystals can form in

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.536
soft joints or tissues.

00:01:05.808 --> 00:01:08.800
The crystals can cause the sudden, severe pain,

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.416
tenderness, and redness which are the symptoms of gout. 

00:01:13.008 --> 00:01:14.880
Treatment for gout includes

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.592
reducing uric acid levels

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.096
by avoiding foods high in purines.
