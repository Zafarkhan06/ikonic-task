00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.800
Hormonal contraceptives are steroid hormones used for birth control.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.140
They contain a small amount of synthetic estrogen, progestin,

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.800
or different combinations of these hormones

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.960
that inhibit the body's natural fertility cycle

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.320
and help prevent pregnancy.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.380
Normally a pregnancy can occur when the hormones

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.180
LH and FSH signal a woman's ovary to release an egg

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.800
allowing a sperm to attach and fertilize it.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.920
Hormonal birth control works by preventing

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.560
the growth of an egg and ovulation.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.100
By preventing the release of LH and FSH

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.160
by the pituitary gland.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.960
Contraceptives thicken cervical mucus

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.620
so that sperm have a more difficult time reaching the egg.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.940
They also make it more difficult for the egg

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.580
to attach to the lining of the uterus.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.480
A number of different types of hormonal contraceptives exist,

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.700
including pills, patches and vaginal rings.
