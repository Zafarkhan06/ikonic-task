Inside of the heart is divided into four chambers.

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.020
The top two chambers are called the Atria,

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.080
and are collection chambers for blood.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.650
The bottom two chambers are called the Ventricles,

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.690
and receive the blood from the Atria,

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.930
and pump it to the lungs and body.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.110
The chambers are separated by valves

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.640
which control the direction of blood flow.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.930
There are four valves:

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:25.700
tricuspid,

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.040
pulmonic,

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.220
mitral

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.490
and aortic.
