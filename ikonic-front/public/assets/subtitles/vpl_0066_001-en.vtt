00:00:00.488 --> 00:00:02.688
A normal heartbeat begins with a group

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:04.904
of specialized pacemaker cells

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.744
called the sinoatrial node

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:07.712
in the heart’s upper,

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.488
right chamber, or atrium.

00:00:09.992 --> 00:00:11.888
Regular electrical impulses

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.888
from these cells cause the atria

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.784
to contract or squeeze,

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.864
pushing blood into the lower chambers,

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.104
or ventricles.

00:00:19.456 --> 00:00:20.984
Traveling down to a junction

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.648
called the atrioventricular,

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:23.832
or AV node,

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.584
and on to the ventricles,

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.280
these impulses cause the

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.984
ventricles to contract.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.344
This pumps blood out to the lungs

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.944
and the rest of the body.

00:00:33.176 --> 00:00:36.680
A ventricular premature beat, or VPB,

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.656
is an extra heartbeat caused

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.392
by electrically unstable

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.128
muscles in the ventricles.

00:00:42.304 --> 00:00:45.504
Also called premature ventricular contractions,

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.256
or ventricular premature contractions,

00:00:48.344 --> 00:00:51.536
VPB’s occur in almost everyone,

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.512
sometimes rarely and sometimes often.
