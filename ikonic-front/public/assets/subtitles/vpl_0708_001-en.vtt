00:00:01.152 --> 00:00:04.320
Thousands of invisible anthrax spores

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.896
can be inhaled through the nose and mouth

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:08.688
in a single breath.

00:00:08.832 --> 00:00:11.296
The pass through the nasal passages,

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.232
past the vocal chords,

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.872
and into the deepest recesses of the lung.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.048
As the spores spread deeper into the lungs,

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.712
individual spores

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.248
attach to the lung's tissue.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.184
A type of white blood cell,

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.368
a macrophage, one of the bodies protection units,

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.664
engulfs the intruding spore,

00:00:33.664 --> 00:00:35.660
and attempts to consume it.

00:00:36.144 --> 00:00:38.776
Some of the anthrax spores survive,

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.224
and are carried by the macrophage

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.216
to lymph glands in the central portion of the chest.

00:00:45.424 --> 00:00:47.512
The rod-shaped bacillis

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.408
emerges from the spore

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.088
with a capsule that protects it from being eaten.

00:00:53.248 --> 00:00:55.768
The bacilli multiply rapidly

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.760
within the macrophage,

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.176
and produce two kinds of toxins;

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.616
called lethal factor and edema factor.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.168
Finally, overwhelmed by the number of bacilli within it,

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.368
the macrophage bursts,

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.584
releasing the anthrax bacilli and its toxins.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.800
The bacilli destroy the lymph glands,

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.632
and spread through the blood

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.168
and throughout the body,

00:01:21.168 --> 00:01:23.160
to all the organs.
