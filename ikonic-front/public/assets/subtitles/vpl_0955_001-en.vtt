00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:05.000
Tetracyclines are antibiotics used to treat a variety

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.160
of bacterial infections, including acne,

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.320
skin infections and others.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.380
Although Tetracyclines don't directly kill the bacteria,

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.460
they prevent it from dividing and spreading.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.740
This allows the bacteria to die

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.400
and the body's immune system to beat the infection.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.280
Tetracyclines work within the bacteria

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.280
by binding to a portion of the bacteria's internal structure

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.640
which prevents essential proteins from binding to it

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.900
and reproduction is blocked.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.720
In addition, Tetracycline alters the cell membrane

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.500
and causes it to leak by weakening the bacteria cell wall.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.220
Our cell structures are different from those of bacteria.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.620
So Tetracycline will not harm our cells

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.580
in the same way as the bacterial cells.
