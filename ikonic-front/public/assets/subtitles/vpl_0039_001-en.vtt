00:00:00.256 --> 00:00:02.736
Smallpox is a brick-shaped virus

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:03.704
that is transmitted

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.560
from one person to another,

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.288
either through direct contact

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.680
or by inhalation.

00:00:09.016 --> 00:00:10.984
An infected person exhales

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.656
thousands of virus particles in each breath

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.592
and inhaling even a few

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.032
can result in virus infection.

00:00:18.384 --> 00:00:19.776
A single virus,

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.024
called a verion,

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.456
lodges in the throat

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.600
or upper respiratory tract. 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.744
The wet mucus membrane binds

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.008
with the outer envelop of the virus

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.976
releasing the inner core materials

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.184
of the verion into the cell.

00:00:33.592 --> 00:00:35.104
The core of the verion

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.208
contains the genetic material,

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.544
or DNA, of the virus.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.664
Viral DNA released into the cell

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.864
becomes a factory for the production

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.344
of viral proteins

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.792
and new smallpox vireons.

00:00:49.232 --> 00:00:51.656
These new veriola viruses

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.440
are eventually released back into the airway

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.448
where they are exhaled into the air

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.152
that other people breathe.

00:00:58.528 --> 00:00:59.912
Over time, you become

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.904
more and more contagious.

00:01:02.256 --> 00:01:04.168
Vireons not exhaled may

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.944
be attacked by macrophages,

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.192
one of the body’s protection units.

00:01:08.408 --> 00:01:10.760
The macrophage removes the virus

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.336
through the lymphatic system,

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.344
which also becomes infected.

00:01:14.768 --> 00:01:16.648
The lymphatics dump waste

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.648
into the circulatory system,

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.424
which is how the virus moves

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.896
into the arteries.

00:01:22.088 --> 00:01:24.904
From there, it is sent to all parts of the body.

00:01:25.224 --> 00:01:27.152
The virus travels through smaller

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.568
and smaller arteries

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.344
until it reaches the capillaries

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.024
just below the skin.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.384
The variola virus infects

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.864
the cells of the skin,

00:01:35.944 --> 00:01:38.224
beginning at its deepest layer.

00:01:38.504 --> 00:01:41.312
Infected cells die and disintegrate.

00:01:41.448 --> 00:01:44.200
Dead cells collected in the spaces between

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.456
living skin cells,

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.872
forming pockets or vesicles.

00:01:48.056 --> 00:01:50.248
Eventually, a rash appears on the

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.528
skin’s surface over the vesicles.

00:01:52.736 --> 00:01:54.680
As more materials collect,

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.232
the vesicles grow.

00:01:56.568 --> 00:01:57.896
Two days later

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.984
the skin has developed pustules

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.360
that are recognizable as

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.192
pox at the surface.

00:02:03.344 --> 00:02:05.208
The pustules begin to dry out

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.680
a few days after that

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.136
and their rounded tops become flattened

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.592
and then slightly depressed at the center.

00:02:11.936 --> 00:02:14.888
Continued drying leads to scab formation.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.472
The scab falls away two to four

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.208
weeks after infection,

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.960
leaving a small scar

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.664
or pox mark.
