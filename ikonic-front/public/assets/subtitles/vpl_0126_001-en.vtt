00:00:00.368 --> 00:00:02.632
If your child has an ankle fracture,

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:03.760
it means one of the

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.216
bones in the ankle joint

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:07.800
(the tibia, fibula, or talus)

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.576
is broken or cracked.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:10.768
This can happen if

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.352
the ankle is twisted.

00:00:12.456 --> 00:00:14.480
If the fracture is at the growth plate

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.160
near the ends of the bone,

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.944
bone growth can be affected

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.000
and may require special X-rays

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.472
or other tests.

00:00:21.664 --> 00:00:23.328
Young bones are more flexible

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.304
than an adult’s,

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.912
so a child’s bone may crack

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.024
or buckle without a clear break,

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.544
instead of snapping like a dry stick.

00:00:30.976 --> 00:00:33.120
An ankle fracture may be treated with

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.168
casts, splints, a removable boot,

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.416
or an air splint

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.624
worn for 4 to 8 weeks.

00:00:39.816 --> 00:00:43.680
Surgery may be needed to straighten

00:00:43.792 --> 00:00:45.248
Your child may need to use

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.272
crutches for several weeks.
