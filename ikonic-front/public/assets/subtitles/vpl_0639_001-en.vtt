00:00:00.992 --> 00:00:03.072
We see through the process of light

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:05.840
being transmitted through the eye to the retina,

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.080
which converts light into electrical 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.672
impulses that are sent to the brain.

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.696
The cornea refracts or

00:00:12.704 --> 00:00:15.008
bends light onto the retina.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.784
If the curve of the cornea is too flat,

00:00:17.816 --> 00:00:19.920
too steep, or irregular,

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.168
light is refracted imperfectly

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.032
onto the retina, which affects vision.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.944
LASIK is a surgical procedure

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.664
to reshape the cornea 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.720
and improve eyesight by correcting so called

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.720
“refractive errors.” 

00:00:35.064 --> 00:00:36.784
For nearsighted people,

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.136
the cornea is too steep and is flattened.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:41.832
For farsighted people,

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.144
the cornea is made steeper.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.944
And an irregular cornea

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.184
is smoothed out for those with astigmatism.

00:00:49.424 --> 00:00:51.568
You’re awake during the procedure,

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.760
and your eyes are anesthetized with

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.760
special numbing drops.

00:00:56.128 --> 00:00:58.816
Your eye is positioned under the laser

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.360
and a device is applied to keep the lids open.

00:01:02.568 --> 00:01:05.048
A map is made of your cornea to highlight

00:01:05.048 --> 00:01:07.040
the areas to be corrected.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.776
The surgeon then creates a thin,

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.432
circular flap of corneal tissue

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.864
using an instrument called

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.432
a microkeratome or a laser.

00:01:15.568 --> 00:01:17.392
The flap is folded back,

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.672
and a different laser is used to remove

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.776
tiny bits of corneal tissue

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.304
to reshape it based on the map.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.064
The flap is then laid back

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.352
over the reshaped corneal tissue.
