00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.640
Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or ACE inhibitors,

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.220
help relax blood vessels and balance body fluids.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.540
They prevent ACE enzyme from causing damage to the body.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.120
ACE attaches itself to Angiotensin I

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.460
to make Angiotensin II.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.560
Angiotensin II is a hormone that attaches to receptor sites

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.140
in blood vessel walls and causes the blood vessels to tighten.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.520
ACE inhibitors attach to ACE

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.520
and block the conversion of Angiotensin I

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.280
to Angiotensin II, allowing more blood to flow through the vessels.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.180
This means that the heart doesn't have to work as hard.
