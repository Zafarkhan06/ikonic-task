00:00:02.768 --> 00:00:06.424
Minor to moderate partial tears of the Achilles tendon

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.464
may only require, applying ice,

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.416
elevating your leg, or compressing it with ACE wraps,

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.864
taking NSAIDs for relief from pain and swelling,

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.680
and avoiding use of the affected leg for 4-6 months,

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.584
except for stretching and strengthening exercises.

00:00:25.064 --> 00:00:28.072
To prevent injury to your Achilles tendon,

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.272
remember to properly warm up and stretch

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.952
before intense physical activity,

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.440
and stretch again afterwards.

00:00:36.536 --> 00:00:39.320
In particular, stretch your calf muscle 

00:00:39.336 --> 00:00:42.576
until you feel a pull but no pain, 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.704
and do not bounce during the stretch.
