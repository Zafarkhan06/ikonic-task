00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.648
reproductive organs,

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:04.296
producing eggs, also called ova,

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.640
and female sex hormones.

00:00:06.808 --> 00:00:09.608
Sometimes a small, fluid-filled sac

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.360
or cyst develops on an ovary.

00:00:12.504 --> 00:00:15.016
Although there are many different types,

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.144
most are noncancerous,

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.032
so-called functional cysts

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:21.072
that occur as part of ovulation

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.184
and the monthly menstrual cycle.

00:00:23.344 --> 00:00:25.304
Developing human eggs in an

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.880
ovary are held in sacs

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.416
called follicles.

00:00:28.536 --> 00:00:30.752
Each month, the most mature egg is

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.272
released when its follicle ruptures.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.512
If a follicle starts to develop

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.408
but does not release an egg,

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.024
a cyst can form.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.424
Many women with an ovarian cyst

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:42.808
have no symptoms,

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.128
and the cyst goes away by itself without treatment.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.016
But sometimes cysts can cause abdominal pain,

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.752
nausea, vomiting, menstrual irregularities,

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.368
and other problems.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.512
A sonogram may be performed to

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.704
evaluate an ovarian cyst;

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.992
and it may need to be surgically removed

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.512
if it does not look like a functional cyst,

00:01:04.544 --> 00:01:06.352
does not shrink on its own,

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:07.752
or gets larger.

00:01:08.032 --> 00:01:10.192
In women of childbearing age,

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.288
most cysts that need to be surgically

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.432
removed are not cancerous.

00:01:14.544 --> 00:01:17.152
The risk of ovarian cancer is increased

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.912
in women aged 50 to 70 years,

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.712
so an ovarian cyst found after menopause

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.984
is usually removed surgically.
