00:00:00.368 --> 00:00:02.552
The motor cortex is a region of

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.472
the outer sheet of brain tissue

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.584
called the cerebral cortex.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:08.328
The movement of every part of

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.048
of the body is controlled by a

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.960
particular region of the motor cortex.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.456
The motor cortex is divided into two parallel bands.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.376
Based on information received

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.272
from other parts of the brain,

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.752
the band in front, called the pre-motor cortex,

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.184
decides which muscles to contract

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.752
to achieve a specific movement.

00:00:30.048 --> 00:00:31.488
The band behind,

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.800
called the primary motor cortex,

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.768
receives this information and

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.688
activates specific muscles

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.240
or groups of muscles

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.288
through motor neurons in the spinal cord.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.336
A seizure is an uncoordinated shaking of the body

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.168
that occurs when cells in the motor cortex

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.336
fire out of sequence.

00:00:51.512 --> 00:00:53.392
When only a small portion of

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.504
the motor cortex is involved,

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.056
only a portion of the muscles of the body,

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.808
like an arm or a leg,

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.896
shakes uncontrollably.

00:01:02.312 --> 00:01:05.248
When more of the motor cortex is involved,

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.168
almost all the muscles of the body convulse,

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.168
causing the person to fall down,

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.264
lose consciousness, and to shake all over.
