00:00:00.792 --> 00:00:02.232
Hair we can see is a

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:04.040
dead protein called keratin.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.184
Keratin is colorless and arranged

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.656
in overlapping scales

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.240
which makes hair flexible.

00:00:09.488 --> 00:00:11.784
The hair cortex contains pigment

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.168
that gives hair its color.

00:00:13.488 --> 00:00:15.584
Hair with abundant pigment is black;

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.328
less is brown or red,

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.256
and no pigment white.

00:00:19.736 --> 00:00:21.352
Hair grows about 6 inches

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:22.920
a year from the living root.

00:00:23.648 --> 00:00:25.360
Balding results from reduced

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.672
hormone levels in both men and women.

00:00:28.288 --> 00:00:30.184
Each follicle has a small muscle

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.040
that raises and lowers the hair,

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.776
trapping warm air in winter

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.864
and blocking out the sun in summer.

00:00:36.496 --> 00:00:38.152
Hair glands produce an oily

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.640
lubricant called sebum

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.576
that keeps hair from drying out.

00:00:41.776 --> 00:00:43.568
A yeast eats sebum,

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.368
irritating the scalp causing cells to die.

00:00:46.624 --> 00:00:48.224
Dead cells appear white

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.840
and are called dandruff.
