00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.530
Many factors determine fat distribution.

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.460
One location that women often store fat

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.040
is on the thighs.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.270
The fat stored in these cells

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:12.410
comes from the blood vessels that provide

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.410
oxygen and nutrients to all your tissues.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.180
As the nutrients spread out through the tissue,

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.470
these cells specifically take up

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.020
and store fat.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.970
As more fat is stored,

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.870
the cells become larger.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.720
With continued growth,

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.720
the cell’s red nucleus may be

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.110
pushed to the side,

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.670
and the cells begin to touch each other.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:35.830
As they grow even larger,

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.620
they begin to fill in the space

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.210
between muscle and the skin above it.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.000
They ultimately grow their own blood vessels

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.210
in order to sustain their growth.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.430
Fat cells can get big enough

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.130
that they’re visible on the outside of the skin

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.800
which is what we call cellulite.
