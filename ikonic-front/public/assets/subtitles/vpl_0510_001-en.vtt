00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.304
The inside of the nose and

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.456
air passages are coated with a lining of

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:06.656
cells that produce mucus.

00:00:06.736 --> 00:00:08.544
This mucus helps to trap

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.400
dust and pollen particles

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.568
before they reach the lungs.

00:00:12.672 --> 00:00:14.480
The cells that produce mucus

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.968
are surrounded by thousands of

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.200
small hairs called cilia.

00:00:18.352 --> 00:00:20.336
These cilia pulse along at

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.944
10 to 20 beats every second.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.928
Cilia force a constant flow of mucus,

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.440
with trapped particles of dust and pollen,

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.056
to the back of the throat,

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.672
where they are either swallowed

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.472
or coughed out of the body.
