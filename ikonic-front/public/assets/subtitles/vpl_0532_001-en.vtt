00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.576
continues to develop

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.472
and external genitalia can be seen.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.464
At 16 weeks, respiration develops.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.872
At 18 weeks, the ears stick out of the head

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.792
and by 20 weeks, downy hair covers the body.

00:00:25.056 --> 00:00:29.400
At 23 weeks, the fetus can respond to sounds.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.440

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.488
suck and hear sounds.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.432

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.568

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.712

00:00:47.952 --> 00:00:51.256
At 28 weeks, the fused eyelids open,

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.344
and the eyes can sense light.

00:00:53.448 --> 00:00:55.768

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.120

At 32 weeks, the skin is red and crinkled.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.072
Fat starts to be deposited to round out the fetus.

00:01:06.624 --> 00:01:09.688
At 34 weeks, if it hasnâ€™t already,

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.904
the fetus begins the descent into the

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.344

At 35 weeks, the fingernails reach the end of the fingertips.

00:01:20.296 --> 00:01:23.872
At 36 weeks, more body fat has formed

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.288
so the body is rounder and less wrinkly.

00:01:27.976 --> 00:01:31.992
At 37 weeks, the lungs are considered mature,

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.968

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.328
