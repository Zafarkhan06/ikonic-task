00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.040
A muscle cramp is a sudden

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.780
and involuntary contraction

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.520
of one or more muscles.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.360
These cramps, also called

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.600
charley horses or muscle spasms,

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.560
are usually the result of straining

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.220
or overusing a muscle.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.780
They can be very painful

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.320
and may last a few seconds

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.860
to several minutes.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.740
Muscle cramps are also common

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.120
at night during sleep,

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.280
especially in leg muscles.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.060
If you tend to get cramps at night,

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.340
stretching before bed can be helpful.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.340
Gently massaging the cramped muscle

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.020
until the cramping stops can help relieve pain.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.260
You might also feel or see a hard

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.620
lump of muscle tissue beneath your skin.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.140
Dehydration or low electrolyte levels

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.280
are a common cause of muscle cramps.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.540
Drink plenty of water

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.540
before and during exercise.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.200
Muscle cramps can also be

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.600
more frequent as you age.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.600
Over time, losing muscle mass

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.860
as you get older can put

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.580
more strain on your muscles.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.160
Often, women who are pregnant

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.240
experience leg cramps due to low electrolyte levels,

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.560
circulation changes,

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.140
and pressure on the nerves

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.760
caused by the growing baby.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.080
Muscle cramps usually resolve on their own

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.560
and are rarely serious enough

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.220
to require medical care.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.980
However, see your doctor if your cramps:

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.120
Donâ€™t improve with self-care

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.420
Are associated with leg swelling, redness or skin changes

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.080
Are associated with muscle weakness

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.260
Staying hydrated,

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:27.480
eating a healthy diet,

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.440
especially foods rich in calcium,

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.140
potassium and magnesium,

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.980
and stretching regularly

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.940
are the best ways to prevent muscle cramps.
