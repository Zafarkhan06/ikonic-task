00:00:00.256 --> 00:00:03.736
Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction.

00:00:04.072 --> 00:00:06.216
It starts with exposure to a substance

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.440
the body identifies as an allergen,

00:00:08.656 --> 00:00:10.696
which produces a series of responses

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.568
by cells of the immune system.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.184
First a dendritic cell captures the allergen,

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:17.552
transforms it,

00:00:17.728 --> 00:00:19.920
and presents it to a T cell.

00:00:20.256 --> 00:00:22.360
The T cell is then transformed

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.256
and sends out molecules called interleukins.

00:00:25.512 --> 00:00:27.376
They transform B cells

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:29.032
into plasma cells,

00:00:29.232 --> 00:00:32.064
which release antibodies called IgE.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.704
The IgE bind to basophils

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.784
in the blood stream and mast cells in tissue.

00:00:38.096 --> 00:00:41.624
At this point, sensitization is complete. 

00:00:42.088 --> 00:00:44.520
Anaphylaxis occurs the next time

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.336
the body encounters the allergen.

00:00:46.776 --> 00:00:48.912
It combines with IgE on

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.248
basophils and mast cells.

00:00:51.744 --> 00:00:53.840
This causes release of chemicals,

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.280
which produce an inflammatory

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.168
response throughout your body.

00:00:57.424 --> 00:00:59.360
Within seconds or minutes,

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.720
your pulse may become weak and rapid.

00:01:02.032 --> 00:01:04.288
A rash or hives may form.

00:01:04.664 --> 00:01:06.240
Your airways may narrow,

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.816
and block your breathing.

00:01:08.888 --> 00:01:11.808
Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency.

00:01:12.136 --> 00:01:14.088
Without an injection of epinephrine,

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.632
a person may die.
