00:00:00.232 --> 00:00:01.936
Your body requires iron

00:00:01.936 --> 00:00:03.930
for many important functions.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:05.712
One of its most important

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:07.584
is transporting oxygen.

00:00:08.104 --> 00:00:10.512
Iron is the connector between oxygen 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:11.968
and red blood cells,

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.648
which carry it from your lungs

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.072
to the rest of your body.

00:00:15.304 --> 00:00:17.928
Foods provide two forms of iron.

00:00:18.048 --> 00:00:20.720
One form, called heme iron,

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.312
comes from animal sources

00:00:22.352 --> 00:00:24.824
like red meat, poultry, and fish.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.784
The other, non-heme iron, 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.256
comes from vegetables and grains.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.744
These two forms have different structures 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.168
and are absorbed in different ways.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.576
Before it can be dissolved and 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.416
absorbed in the small intestine, 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.768
non-heme iron must be converted

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.592
to a soluble form and bound to another substance. 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.272
Heme iron does not need to be

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.552
converted and bound to another protein.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.720
It is absorbed in different receptor sites

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.344
from non-heme iron.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.340
Most of the iron in your body

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.632
is stored in your liver,

00:00:55.632 --> 00:00:57.630
spleen, and bone marrow

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.240
and released as needed.

00:00:59.408 --> 00:01:02.240
Excess iron is stored in your liver and heart.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.568
Too much can damage these organs.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.472
Insufficient iron can make you feel tired,

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.056
weak, or irritable, 

00:01:09.216 --> 00:01:12.112
more prone to infections, and other problems.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.168
Only a medical professional can determine

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.088
whether you have too little iron,

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.272
whatâ€™s causing it,

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.904
and what to do about it.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.392
Some people are advised

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.072
to take iron supplements.

00:01:22.408 --> 00:01:25.168
In the past, these were available only as

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.744
non-heme iron.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.696
Due to the absorption process,

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.440
non-heme iron can cause

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.504
unpleasant effects, such as constipation.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.216
heme and non-heme iron,

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.736
which increases absorption

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.520
and also reduce these unwanted effects.
