00:00:00.232 --> 00:00:03.672
Approximately 7.4 million new cases

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:05.360
of bacterial vaginosis

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.344
are diagnosed in the United States each year,

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.920
making it the most common vaginal infection

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.664
among women of childbearing age.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.312
Normally, there is a complex and intricate

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:19.400
balance of bacteria and yeast in the vagina.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.432
Helpful bacteria keep the growth

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.616
of harmful bacteria in check,

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.248
and the normal acidity or

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.264
pH of the vagina inhibits their growth.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.368
This normal balance is sometimes altered

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.152
through a variety of different mechanisms.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.232
The population of good bacteria,

00:00:36.232 --> 00:00:38.648
such as a type called lactobacilli,

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.968
are reduced and replaced by harmful bacteria,

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.656
which increase and cause symptoms.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.944
One type is called Gardnerella vaginalis.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.504
 Another is called Mobiluncus.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.744
Overgrowth of these and other harmful bacteria

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.008
can cause vaginal irritation,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.064
itching, unpleasant odor,

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.200
and a sticky white or gray discharge.

00:01:01.376 --> 00:01:03.384
Diagnosis usually involves a

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.016
pelvic exam and laboratory tests.

00:01:06.128 --> 00:01:08.504
Although it may resolve without treatment,

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.304
the infection should be treated

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.824
to prevent possible complications.
