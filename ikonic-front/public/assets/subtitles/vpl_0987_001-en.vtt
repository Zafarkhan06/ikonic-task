00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.580
HIV or human immunodeficiency viruses is the cause of AIDS.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.800
It can infect the bloodstream following

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.420
unprotected sex from an infected person,

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.420
exposure to infected blood,

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.220
or can be passed from an infected pregnant mother to her child.

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:20.020
Having unprotected sex or sharing drug injection equipment

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.380
with a person infected with HIV

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.940
are the two most common ways to become infected.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.980
Once infected, the HIV virus attacks and destroys

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.240
the infection fighting CD4 cells of the body's immune system.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.800
The loss of the immune system leaves patients

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.420
vulnerable to illnesses,

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.900
including cancer, opportunistic infections and dementia. 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.560
There is no cure for HIV AIDS,

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.820
but there are treatments that slow the progression of AIDS

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.440
by limiting the number of immune cells that are destroyed.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.620
The body can then replace the ones that are lost.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.940
There are combination of drugs used to treat HIV

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.860
called cocktails or triple therapy.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.380
These cocktails attack HIV in different ways

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:07.300
and protect the immune system

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.640
so it can continue to fight infections.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.980
One part of the cocktail is called

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:19.400
Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors or NNRTIs

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.360
After HIV enters the immune cell

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.900
it starts to make copies of itself,

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.360
but before it can make those copies

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.680
NNRTI medications block the virus from replicating.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.180
NNRTI medications are part of the HIV cocktail

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.800
that work before HIV can make more copies of itself.
