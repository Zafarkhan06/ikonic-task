00:00:00.392 --> 00:00:03.248
Sitting on the toilet for long periods of time,

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.328
straining during bowel movements,

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.128
and chronic constipation

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.152
can all put pressure on the veins

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.448
in your anus and lower rectum.

00:00:11.592 --> 00:00:14.048
The pressure can inhibit the flow of blood

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.544
so that the veins bulge or swell,

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.696
producing the condition known as hemorrhoids.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.024
Some hemorrhoids are internal,

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.064
lying inside the rectum.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.032
You can’t see or feel them

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.648
and since the area lacks pain receptors,

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.304
they usually don’t cause discomfort.

00:00:31.696 --> 00:00:35.064
Other hemorrhoids, known as external hemorrhoids,

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.168
develop under the skin around the anus.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.168
Pooling blood can form a lump or clot.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.984
Straining also sometimes

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.552
pushes an internal hemorrhoid

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.416
through the anal opening.

00:00:46.576 --> 00:00:49.288
These hemorrhoids often itch or bleed,

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.208
sometimes with severe pain and swelling.
