00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:03.990
Angioplasty is a procedure used to open

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.990
narrowed arteries that supply blood to the body.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.990
The blocked artery may be anywhere in the body.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.100
Your healthcare provider inserts a balloon catheter,

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.060
a thin, flexible tube,

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:18.390
into the narrowed or blocked artery,

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.980
inflating a balloon at the tip of the catheter

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.040
to stretch the narrowed artery.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.320
Then the balloon is deflated

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.960
and the catheter and balloon are withdrawn.
