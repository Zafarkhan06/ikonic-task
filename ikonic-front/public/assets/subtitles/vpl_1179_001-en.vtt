00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.720
We have over 600 muscles in our body.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.600
They make up between 1/3 and 1/2 of our body weight.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.340
And whether or not body building is your hobby,

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.500
muscles need your constant attention

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.100
because the way you treat them on a daily basis

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.380
determines whether they will wither or grow.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.580
As you expose your muscles to stress,

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.240
they experience microscopic damage,

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.180
which, in this context, is a good thing.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.620
In response, the injured cells release

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.160
inflammatory molecules called cytokines that

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.040
activate the immune system to repair the injury.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.120
This is when the muscle-building magic happens.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.360
The greater the damage to the muscle tissue,

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.820
the more your body will need to repair itself.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.560
The resulting cycle of damage and repair

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.380
is what eventually makes muscles

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.660
bigger and stronger as they adapt to

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.920
progressively greater demands.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.760
Since our bodies have already

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.960
adapted to most everyday activities,

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.360
those generally don't produce enough stress

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.140
to stimulate new muscle growth.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.980
So, to build new muscle,

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.860
a process called hypertrophy,

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.520
our cells need to be exposed

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.920
to higher workloads than they are used to.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.580
In fact, if you don't continuously expose

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.240
your muscles to some resistance, they will shrink,

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.200
a process known as muscular atrophy. 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.300
However, muscles rely on more

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.020
than just activity to grow.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.960
Without proper nutrition, hormones, and rest,

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.700
your body would never be able to

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.700
repair damaged muscle fibers.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.000
Protein in our diet preserves muscle mass

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.640
by providing the building blocks for

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.140
new tissue in the form of amino acids.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.780
Adequate protein intake,

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.000
along with naturally occurring hormones,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.880
like insulin-like growth factor (IGF)

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.380
and testosterone,

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.340
help shift the body into a state

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.460
where tissue is repaired and grown.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.340
This vital repair process

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.060
mainly occurs when we're resting,

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.360
especially at night while sleeping.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.800
Gender and age is also a major influence,

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.320
which is why young men with more testosterone

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.500
have a leg up in the muscle building game.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.300
Genetic factors also play a role

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.400
in one's ability to grow muscle.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.920
Some people have more robust

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.800
immune reactions to muscle damage,

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.600
and are better able to repair and

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.420
replace damaged muscle fibers,

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.860
increasing their muscle-building potential.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.060
The body responds to the demands you place on it.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.900
If you tear your muscles up,

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.880
eat right, rest and repeat,

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.700
you'll create the conditions to make

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.900
your muscles as big and strong as possible.
