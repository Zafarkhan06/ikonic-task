00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.024
Your thyroid is a bow-tie shaped gland

00:00:03.024 --> 00:00:05.020
located in the front of your neck.

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.032
It produces hormones that regulate

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:08.528
the metabolism of cells

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.544
throughout your body

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.432
through a two-way interaction

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:12.496
with your brain.

00:00:12.736 --> 00:00:15.048
When thyroid hormone levels are low,

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.560
a part of the brain called the hypothalamus

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.376
produces thyrotropin releasing hormone

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.072
or TRH.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.568
TRH causes the pituitary gland

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:25.976
at the base of the brain

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.536
to produce thyroid stimulating hormone,

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.104
or TSH.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.584
And TSH signals the thyroid

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.008
to increase production of its hormones.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.248
When blood levels of thyroid hormones increase,

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.576
the hypothalamus and pituitary gland

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.112
decrease production of TRH and TSH.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.336
Sometimes the thyroid gland cannot

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:47.800
produce enough hormones,

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.264
but the pituitary gland

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.424
continues to send TSH to the thyroid.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.168
This can cause the thyroid

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.848
to become enlarged.
