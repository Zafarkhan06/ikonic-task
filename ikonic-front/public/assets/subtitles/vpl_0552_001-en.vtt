00:00:00.528 --> 00:00:02.968
The cervix is the lower, narrow portion of

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.408
the uterus that connects with

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.976
the top of the vagina.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.392
Most cases of cervical cancer

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:12.008
are caused by human papillomavirus, or HPV.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.768
Of almost 200 strains of HPV,

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.992
approximately 30 to 40 types

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:18.880
are sexually transmitted.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.328
Some cause genital warts.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.392
Others called “high-risk” types

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.320
can cause cervical cancer.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.296
An HPV virus invades a normal cell.

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.408
The virus’s genetic information, or genome,

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.440
is released and transported to the

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.328
nucleus of the host cell,

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.920
where it uses host cell mechanisms to replicate.

00:00:40.176 --> 00:00:42.104
In a small group of women,

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.912
HPV converts normal cervical cells

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.512
into cancerous ones,

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.640
which reproduce uncontrollably

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.456
and do not die, as normal cells do.

00:00:51.912 --> 00:00:54.760
Cervical cancer is usually slow-growing,

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.888
and regular Pap tests have greatly

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.184
reduced deaths from this cancer.

00:00:59.312 --> 00:01:00.864
A new vaccine prevents

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.224
many cervical cancers from developing.
