00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:05.930
An asthma attack refers to wheezing,

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:07.830
coughing, and shortness of breath.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.850
Asthma causes the airways to become inflamed,

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:12.960
swollen, and produce mucus.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.960
Asthma runs in families

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.220
and usually starts before adulthood.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.860
It is more common in those with allergies

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.360
and made worse by second hand smoke,

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.290
pollution, cold air, and other factors.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.340
Those with asthma may use a

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.210
daily inhaled medication

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.630
called a controller

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.470
and an inhaler with albuterol

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.320
called a rescue medication,

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.320
for quick action during an attack.
