00:00:01.624 --> 00:00:03.472
Alzheimer’s disease is the most

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:05.192
common form of dementia.

00:00:05.424 --> 00:00:06.512
Research has shown

00:00:06.512 --> 00:00:07.728
that the brains of people with

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.064
Alzheimer’s disease have

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.120
low levels of acetylcholine.

00:00:11.456 --> 00:00:13.208
This chemical permits nerves

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.256
to transmit signals between areas of

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:16.592
the brain responsible for

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.136
brain communication.

00:00:18.488 --> 00:00:20.160
Brain communication also

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.936
declines as neurons

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.560
cells that process and transmit information

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.032
degenerate or become a

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:27.928
tangled mass of fibers.

00:00:28.096 --> 00:00:29.888
Other changes include production

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.152
of an abnormal protein

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:32.384
called amyloid,

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:33.800
which forms a kind of plaque

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.392
that is toxic to nearby brain cells.

00:00:36.576 --> 00:00:38.272
It isn’t fully understood why

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:39.872
these changes happen in some people

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:40.984
and not others,

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.352
although genetics appear

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:43.560
to play a role.
