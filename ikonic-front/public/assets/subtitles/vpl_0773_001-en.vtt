00:00:01.896 --> 00:00:04.760
A complete rupture to the Achilles tendon

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.384
is caused by excessive strain.

00:00:07.552 --> 00:00:10.024
Intense physical activity involving

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.784
pushing off from the ground,

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.488
or pointing your foot down,

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.952
strains the Achilles tendon.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:17.728
If the tendon is weak

00:00:17.728 --> 00:00:19.312
or the calf muscles have not 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.376
been warmed up and stretched,

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:23.232
the tendon may be prone to 

00:00:23.232 --> 00:00:25.230
tear under the strain.

00:00:25.568 --> 00:00:27.784
When the Achilles tendon tears,

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.232
a pop may be felt or heard

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.944
and is followed immediately by pain

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.608
and later by tenderness, swelling, and stiffness.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.704
It will become difficult or painful to walk,

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.952
or simply point your foot.
