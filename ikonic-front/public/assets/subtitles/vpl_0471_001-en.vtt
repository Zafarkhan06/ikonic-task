00:00:00.304 --> 00:00:02.056
The ovaries are located on

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:03.848
each side of the uterus.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.656
Inside the ovaries are

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:08.464
follicles containing immature eggs.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.480
Each month during ovulation,

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.232
a follicle in one ovary

00:00:12.232 --> 00:00:14.168
releases a single mature egg

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.320
for possible fertilization.

00:00:16.616 --> 00:00:18.736
Ovulation occurs in response to

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.064
hormones called luteinizing hormone,

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.232
or LH,

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.520
and follicle-stimulating hormone,

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.128
or FSH.

00:00:26.264 --> 00:00:29.464
LH and FSH are produced by the tiny

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.168
pituitary gland at the base of the brain.

00:00:32.848 --> 00:00:36.792
LH and FSH also stimulate the ovarian follicles

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.224
in the ovaries to produce estrogen and progesterone,

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.360
which are responsible for female sexual

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.616
characteristics and preparing the uterus

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.392
for a fertilized egg.

00:00:46.632 --> 00:00:50.912
With aging, the number of ovarian follicles declines

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.480
and the follicles become less

00:00:52.496 --> 00:00:55.096
responsive to LH and FSH,

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.184
so they begin to produce less estrogen.

00:00:58.608 --> 00:01:01.096
Ovulation and menstruation become more

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.416
irregular and eventually cease,

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.752
which we call menopause.

00:01:06.168 --> 00:01:07.968
Along with these changes,

00:01:07.968 --> 00:01:09.960
skin may become drier.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.048
The hair on the head may thin;

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.376
while facial hair becomes coarser

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.720
and abdominal fat deposits may increase.
