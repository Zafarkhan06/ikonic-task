00:05.163 --> 00:07.683
Sepsis is a life-threatening illness.

00:07.683 --> 00:12.098
It is caused when your body has an extreme reaction to an infection.

00:12.098 --> 00:15.663
Sepsis occurs when the chemicals your immune system releases

00:15.663 --> 00:18.112
into your bloodstream to fight an infection

00:18.112 --> 00:20.654
trigger inflammation throughout the body.

00:20.654 --> 00:23.487
This inflammation can damage your organs

00:23.487 --> 00:25.334
and they may stop working.

00:25.334 --> 00:28.734
Without treatment sepsis may lead to death.

00:28.734 --> 00:30.998
Sepsis is most common in:

00:30.998 --> 00:33.498
Adults older than 65

00:33.498 --> 00:35.673
Children younger than 1

00:35.673 --> 00:38.122
People with weakened immune systems

00:38.122 --> 00:41.067
People who have chronic medical conditions,

00:41.067 --> 00:45.502
such as diabetes, kidney disease, cancer, or lung disease

00:45.502 --> 00:48.075
Symptoms of sepsis include:

00:48.075 --> 00:51.137
Fever, shivering, or feeling cold

00:51.137 --> 00:53.270
Sweating or clammy skin

00:53.270 --> 00:54.937
Fast heart rate

00:54.937 --> 00:56.795
Difficulty breathing

00:56.795 --> 00:58.486
Low blood pressure

00:58.486 --> 01:00.169
Mental confusion

01:00.169 --> 01:01.899
Pain or discomfort

01:01.899 --> 01:04.709
If your doctor determines you have sepsis,

01:04.709 --> 01:09.037
you’ll get medicines to stop the infection and manage your symptoms.

01:09.037 --> 01:13.119
You may also get fluids through an IV or a machine for breathing.

01:13.119 --> 01:15.411
Some people need kidney dialysis or

01:15.411 --> 01:18.674
surgery to remove the source of the infection.

01:18.674 --> 01:21.513
Sepsis ranges from mild to severe.

01:21.513 --> 01:24.318
Most people recover from mild sepsis

01:24.318 --> 01:26.884
when it’s identified early and treated quickly.

01:26.884 --> 01:34.257
Without treatment, sepsis can progress quickly and the risk of death increases.
