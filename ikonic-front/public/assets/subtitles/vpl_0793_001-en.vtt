00:00:02.112 --> 00:00:04.800
Welcome to the Joint Care Pathway.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.400
This program is designed to help 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.936
you prepare for total joint surgery.

00:00:09.272 --> 00:00:11.232
Our goal is to help you navigate

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.456
the decisions needed to maximize your

00:00:13.456 --> 00:00:16.536
recovery and outcomes and limit problems or

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.552
complications before, during, and after your surgery.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.744
Prior to your surgery,

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.456
you and your surgeon will need to make

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.400
decisions regarding your postoperative recovery.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.888
Many patients will benefit from a visit

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.704
with a physical therapist to help

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.424
prepare for and set expectations following surgery.

00:00:37.584 --> 00:00:41.176
Maximizing your preoperative motion and conditioning

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.088
will pay dividends after your surgery is complete

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.664
and you strive to meet your rehabilitation goals.

00:00:47.832 --> 00:00:49.808
You and your surgeon should also discuss

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.632
plans for postoperative blood clot prevention,

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.312
discharge plans,

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.720
other medical needs or visits,

00:00:56.944 --> 00:00:58.864
physical therapy plans

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.408
and who to call if you are having problems. 

00:01:03.312 --> 00:01:06.080
Following surgery, you will need to make plans

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.344
on where to go when you leave the hospital.

00:01:10.032 --> 00:01:11.432
Most patients will be able to

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.872
return home following discharge.

00:01:14.152 --> 00:01:15.928
The majority of patients benefit

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.272
from being at home

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.856
and leaving the house for therapy visits.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.120
This will require some help at home

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.624
from family or friends,

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.408
and often requires some preoperative planning

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.920
to make sure you have the help 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.800
needed when you arrive home.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.104
Most surgeons prefer their patients

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.216
be at home after the hospital stay is complete.

00:01:35.584 --> 00:01:38.288
Patients who return home tend to recover more

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.960
predictably with fewer problems.

00:01:41.392 --> 00:01:44.920
If you plan on returning home following your hospital stay,

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.168
arrange for your physical therapy visits

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.280
following discharge from the hospital.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.568
If you plan to return home following surgery,

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.104
but are unable to arrange for transportation

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.000
for your physical therapy visits,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.888
you may benefit from home health care visits and therapy.

00:02:01.112 --> 00:02:03.832
Although we prefer outpatient therapy,

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.984
home therapy visits may benefit

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.720
those unable to leave the house

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.120
until they are able to secure transportation

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.000
to and from outpatient physical therapy.

00:02:13.552 --> 00:02:16.128
Some joint replacement patients are not safe

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.776
to return home after their hospital stay.

00:02:18.904 --> 00:02:20.832
The most common reason is that they lack

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.632
the ability to safely navigate

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.320
their home environment without risk of falling.

00:02:25.608 --> 00:02:27.576
For these patients and others who have

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.904
significant health issues or other medical concerns,

00:02:31.024 --> 00:02:32.792
a short stay at a skilled

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.184
nursing facility may be required.

00:02:35.392 --> 00:02:37.328
Most patients who are discharged

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.224
to a skilled nursing facility

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.000
benefit if they return home

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.936
with outpatient physical therapy

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.224
as soon as they are capable of returning home safely. 

00:02:46.608 --> 00:02:49.880
For most, a stay at the skilled nursing facility

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.856
can be limited to 7 to 10 days following discharge.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.424
The goal of this stay

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.096
is to make you functionally independent.

00:02:58.216 --> 00:02:59.712
When you reach the point that you

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.360
can get in and out of bed on your own

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.104
and use a walker to safely

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.960
navigate your home environment,

00:03:06.064 --> 00:03:08.376
you will benefit from returning home.

00:03:08.544 --> 00:03:09.904
It takes several months to 

00:03:09.904 --> 00:03:11.900
completely recover from surgery

00:03:12.024 --> 00:03:13.648
and the remainder of the recovery

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.504
is best completed at home.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.216
Once you are home,

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:19.136
it is best to start outpatient

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.568
physical therapy as soon as possible.

00:03:22.992 --> 00:03:25.816
Most patients following total joint surgery

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.952
will develop a plan with their surgeon

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.376
for minimizing the chance for postoperative blood clots.

00:03:32.456 --> 00:03:34.808
The most common treatments are aspirin,

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.768
Coumadin or warfarin,

00:03:36.856 --> 00:03:38.576
or injectable blood thinners

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.112
such as Lovenox.

00:03:40.472 --> 00:03:43.488
Patients who are on blood thinners before surgery

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.048
may be asked to stop these medications

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.160
several days prior to surgery.

00:03:48.352 --> 00:03:50.504
You should discuss home medications

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.304
and management of blood thinners and

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.192
blood clot prevention with your surgeon

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.032
or case management specialist.

00:03:57.264 --> 00:03:59.344
Following surgery you may have questions

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.080
or problems that develop.

00:04:02.112 --> 00:04:04.840
If you have what you consider to be an emergency

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.704
or life-threatening condition,

00:04:06.912 --> 00:04:08.872
please call 911

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.808
or go to the emergency room for evaluation.

00:04:12.144 --> 00:04:14.848
For most concerns that are not life threatening,

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.448
we prefer you contact your treating physician

00:04:17.448 --> 00:04:19.440
or case management specialist.

00:04:19.808 --> 00:04:22.632
If your surgeon's staff is unavailable,

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.288
please attempt to contact your

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.872
case management specialist

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.496
or the on-call physician for the office.

00:04:28.808 --> 00:04:31.184
In general, these questions or concerns

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.976
can be best managed effectively

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.288
through a phone call or office visit.

00:04:35.376 --> 00:04:37.464
Visiting an emergency department or

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.480
urgent care facility for nonemergent problems

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.792
is rarely useful as these facilities

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:44.952
are not familiar with your case.

00:04:45.352 --> 00:04:46.776
Prior to surgery

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.816
please be aware who you should call

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.344
for concerns if they arise

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.088
after your joint replacement. 

00:04:52.304 --> 00:04:55.112
If you have other medical concerns or needs,

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.888
we ask that you manage these

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.320
prior to your surgery.

00:04:59.312 --> 00:05:01.352
Non orthopaedic procedures

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.392
or medical treatment of any kind

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:05.088
should be addressed prior to your

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.120
joint replacement if possible.

00:05:07.328 --> 00:05:09.568
In general, it is advised that

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.544
other medical procedures be delayed

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.344
for approximately 3 months

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.064
following your joint replacement,

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.696
as they may interfere with

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.608
or complicate your joint replacement recovery.

00:05:19.912 --> 00:05:21.768
We would recommend that you continue

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.288
with your regular scheduled doctor appointments

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.160
with your primary care provider,

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.312
heart specialist,

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.040
respiratory specialist

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.472
or other physicians involved in the important

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.656
aspects of your health maintenance.

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.584
In the event that you do have an

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.472
elective procedure or surgery

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.032
scheduled within 3 months of your surgery,

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:41.792
please discuss this with us

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:43.480
and we will help counsel you on the

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.936
best time to consider these procedures. 

00:05:47.224 --> 00:05:49.728
Following surgery, you may experience

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.296
a number of issues common to

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:52.888
total joint patients.

00:05:53.888 --> 00:05:55.512
It is important to know that it

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:57.480
is not uncommon for your incision

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.912
to be slightly red.

00:05:59.264 --> 00:06:00.888
Low-grade fevers are common

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.952
in the first week following surgery

00:06:02.952 --> 00:06:04.950
and rarely indicate a problem.

00:06:05.496 --> 00:06:08.952
Infections are rare following total joint surgery

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:12.832
and usually present after 7 days following surgery.

00:06:13.128 --> 00:06:14.960
Most infections will present

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.040
with a dramatic increase in pain,

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.288
swelling, and fevers.

00:06:19.416 --> 00:06:21.512
If you experience these symptoms

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:25.096
call your surgeon's office or case management specialist.

00:06:25.328 --> 00:06:27.080
Most surgeons prefer that their

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.144
total joint patients not be placed

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:32.480
on antibiotics without being thoroughly evaluated

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.200
by the treating physician or his staff. 

00:06:35.568 --> 00:06:37.888
If you receive a urinary catheter,

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.888
following surgery you may have a

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.552
higher chance of a urinary tract infection.

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:45.752
If you have burning and a need to urinate frequently,

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:48.016
contact your surgeon, their staff

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:50.288
or your case management specialist.

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:54.048
If you experience significant calf pain and swelling,

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.344
shortness of breath,

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.456
or chest pain following surgery,

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:58.928
contact your surgeon.

00:06:59.144 --> 00:07:01.680
If these symptoms seem life-threatening

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.640
please call 911

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.928
or go to the nearest emergency room. 

00:07:07.896 --> 00:07:10.072
We are excited about the opportunity

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:12.728
to help you with your osteoarthritic joint.

00:07:13.304 --> 00:07:16.224
Joint replacements can greatly enhance your life

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:18.520
and improve your activity level

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:19.864
while limiting your pain

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.992
during activities of daily living.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.432
It is important that your recovery

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:26.896
and rehabilitation be your focus

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:28.680
for the next several months.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:30.632
We will do everything we can

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:32.560
to help you through this process

00:07:32.608 --> 00:07:35.456
and please do not hesitate to contact us

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:36.992
if you have any questions

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:39.960
or concerns as the process proceeds.
