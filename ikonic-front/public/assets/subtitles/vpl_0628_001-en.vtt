00:00:00.272 --> 00:00:02.648
Acetaminophen is the generic name

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.928
for a drug found in many over the counter

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.936
and prescription medications.

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.600
Although generally safe,

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.672
 taking too much acetaminophen can

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.800
cause serious liver damage.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.664
After you take acetaminophen in a pill form,

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.080
it passes down your esophagus into your stomach.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.888
It is broken into particles that

00:00:20.888 --> 00:00:22.880
pass into the small intestine.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.880
It is absorbed through the walls of the small intestine

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.320
into your bloodstream

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.920
and begins to relieve symptoms like pain or fever.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.968
The bloodstream ultimately filters through the liver,

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.936
where the drug is metabolized or

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.792
broken down to be eliminated in urine.

00:00:39.568 --> 00:00:42.360
Most is broken into safe components.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.576
But a small amount is broken down

00:00:44.576 --> 00:00:47.720
into a substance called NAPQI,

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.144
which is a toxic byproduct.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.872
At recommended doses,

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.248
this byproduct is also safely removed in urine. 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.920
But if too much acetaminophen is taken,

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.992
too much NAPQI is produced,

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.336
which harms liver cells called hepatocytes. 

00:01:04.456 --> 00:01:06.288
Damage can range from abnormal

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.096
liver function blood tests

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.040
to acute liver failure or even death.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.224
It is dose related, meaning the higher the dose,

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.920
the more damage is likely to occur.

00:01:17.048 --> 00:01:18.672
Early symptoms can include

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.768
loss of appetite, nausea, and vomiting.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.384
Other signs of damage become evident over several days.

00:01:25.384 --> 00:01:27.380
If overdose is suspected,

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.888
seek medical help immediately.
