00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.376
Generally, the first problem to develop

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.472
in someone with type 2 diabetes

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.576
is a condition called insulin resistance.

00:00:07.712 --> 00:00:10.432
This means that glucose—a form of sugar

00:00:10.576 --> 00:00:12.808
can’t enter cells the way it should.

00:00:13.048 --> 00:00:15.808
Glucose is formed from the breakdown of foods,

00:00:15.808 --> 00:00:17.800
especially carbohydrates.

00:00:17.976 --> 00:00:21.824
Normally, glucose attaches to cells of the pancreas,

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.560
which triggers the cells to produce 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.392
a hormone called insulin.

00:00:25.992 --> 00:00:27.928
The insulin attaches to receptors

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.528
on the membrane of most cells in the body.

00:00:30.936 --> 00:00:33.480
This allows the glucose to enter the cell,

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.952
to be used for fuel.

00:00:35.256 --> 00:00:37.768
In people with insulin resistance,

00:00:37.888 --> 00:00:40.056
the insulin can still attach normally

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.112
to the receptors on these cells.

00:00:42.328 --> 00:00:44.152
But various mechanisms prevent

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.232
the insulin from moving the glucose into the cells

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.760
to be used for fuel. 

00:00:49.128 --> 00:00:52.088
When the glucose can’t enter cells as it should,

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.888
blood levels of glucose rise

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.640
to abnormally high levels.

00:00:55.832 --> 00:00:59.272
This problem is called hyperglycemia.
