00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.728
Retinopathy means damage to the retina,

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.840
a layer of light-sensitive nerve

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.392
tissue lining the back of the eye.

00:00:08.592 --> 00:00:10.624
The retina is filled with tiny

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.952
blood vessels called capillaries.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:14.488
They carry blood containing 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.024
oxygen and nutrients to the retina.

00:00:17.416 --> 00:00:19.384
Too much sugar in your blood

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.912
can cause changes to these blood vessels,

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:23.712
which can lead to vision problems

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.528
and even blindness.

00:00:25.656 --> 00:00:28.904
There are several types of diabetic retinopathy.

00:00:29.128 --> 00:00:31.272
In its most severe form,

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.752
new, fragile blood vessels grow in the retina.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.272
They sometimes grow into the vitreous,

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.376
the clear jelly-like substance that

00:00:39.376 --> 00:00:41.370
fills the center of your eye.

00:00:41.504 --> 00:00:45.128
These fragile blood vessels may leak or bleed.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.648
Small scars can develop on the retina

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.336
and in the vitreous.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.904
Diabetic retinopathy can occur in

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.704
people with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

00:00:55.784 --> 00:00:58.168
Early on, there may be no symptoms.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.768
But as it progresses,

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.344
diabetic retinopathy can cause many vision problems

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.200
including blurred vision,

00:01:05.952 --> 00:01:08.048
difficulty seeing at night,

00:01:08.896 --> 00:01:10.832
spots or floaters,

00:01:11.576 --> 00:01:14.296
dark or empty areas in your vision,

00:01:14.888 --> 00:01:18.176
and eventually, total vision loss.

00:01:18.312 --> 00:01:20.688
It is important for anyone with diabetes

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.872
to have their eyes checked regularly,

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.120
and for anyone with ongoing vision problems

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.096
to be checked out by a doctor.
