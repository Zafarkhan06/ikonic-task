00:00:00.872 --> 00:00:02.760
Total hip arthroplasty,

00:00:03.032 --> 00:00:05.320
also called total hip replacement,

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.432
begins with an incision to allow

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.664
access to the bones of the hip joint.

00:00:10.192 --> 00:00:11.808
The next step is to remove

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.480
damaged cartilage and bone

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.696
from the acetabulum,

00:00:14.984 --> 00:00:17.256
the cup-shaped hollow in the pelvic bone.

00:00:18.104 --> 00:00:19.552
This damage results from the

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.824
bones rubbing directly against each other

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.152
when protective cartilage wears away.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.944
A tool called a reamer

00:00:26.944 --> 00:00:28.940
is used to prepare the hip bone

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.472
to receive the socket portion

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:31.688
of the hip replacement.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.784
This metal and plastic combination

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.344
is called the acetabular component

00:00:37.672 --> 00:00:38.888
and is fitted into the

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.136
newly reamed surface

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:41.832
of healthy bone and tissue.

00:00:42.336 --> 00:00:44.528
The outer, metal part of this component,

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.224
sometimes called a cup,

00:00:46.408 --> 00:00:48.512
fits directly into the socket.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.800
The inner, plastic portion

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.904
has a hollow to hold the replacement

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.480
for the ball-shaped bone at the

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.424
top of the thighbone, or femur.

00:00:56.984 --> 00:00:59.048
The outer, metal part is rough

00:00:59.136 --> 00:01:02.144
to help bone grow into its surface over time

00:01:02.256 --> 00:01:04.896
to lock the artificial socket in place.

00:01:05.472 --> 00:01:06.488
The next step

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.184
is removing the ball-shaped head

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.896
of the femur, or thighbone,

00:01:10.136 --> 00:01:12.056
and preparing the femur for placement

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.072
of the stem portion of the component.

00:01:14.392 --> 00:01:16.112
A metal ball is attached

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.536
to the end of the stem

00:01:17.776 --> 00:01:19.832
and fits into the artificial socket

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:20.816
in the hipbone.

00:01:21.328 --> 00:01:23.344
Together, these components replace

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.552
the natural ball and socket joint.

00:01:26.136 --> 00:01:28.064
During and after surgery,

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.384
the surgeon verifies the correct fit

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.520
and range of motion

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.456
of the hip replacement components.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.944
By mimicking the anatomy and function

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.432
of the natural hip joint,

00:01:37.712 --> 00:01:39.920
hip replacement can reduce pain

00:01:40.064 --> 00:01:42.928
and permit a return to many activities.
