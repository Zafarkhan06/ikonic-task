00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.440
Platelet aggregation inhibitors help prevent heart attacks and strokes

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.220
by decreasing excessive blood clotting.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.620
They do this by preventing platelets from becoming sticky and clumping.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.860
Platelets are blood cells that naturally collect to form clots

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.000
and stop bleeding when there is damage to cells.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.840
When platelets form clots in the blood vessels,

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.560
this can restrict or block blood flow in vessels.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.580
This can lead to strokes and heart attacks.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.180
Platelet aggregation inhibitors once active

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.460
prevent platelets from clumping.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.800
These drugs bind to platelets for its entire life,

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.900
about seven to ten days.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.080
Consequently, platelets can only clump

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.500
when the body releases new platelets into circulation

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.200
that haven't bee affected by the drug.
