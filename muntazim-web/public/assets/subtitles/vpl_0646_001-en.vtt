00:00:00.424 --> 00:00:02.944
Angina is chest pain that occurs

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:04.384
when the heart muscle is not

00:00:04.384 --> 00:00:06.380
getting enough oxygen.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.744
It is commonly described as a crushing

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.392
or squeezing pain in the chest.

00:00:11.792 --> 00:00:14.240
Oxygen is carried by red blood cells

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.832
and delivered to the heart muscle

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.120
via the coronary arteries.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.728
Over the years, the insides of the

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.944
coronary arteries can narrow.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.384
The most common cause is a build-up of plaque.

00:00:26.576 --> 00:00:29.744
As the insides of the arteries become narrow,

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.632
blood flow is reduced,

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.328
and your heart has to work harder

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.552
to get the oxygen it needs.
