00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.520
Having a baby can trigger a lot of powerful emotions,

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.400
from excitement and joy

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.220
to fear and anxiety.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:10.900
But it can also result in something

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.400
you might not expect

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.640
depression.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.580
In fact, it’s common for most

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.840
new moms to experience what’s known as

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.020
“baby blues” after childbirth,

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.160
usually beginning one to four days after delivery

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.260
and subsiding within two weeks without treatment.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.360
Having support and asking for help

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.660
from friends, family and your partner

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.660
goes a long way to help during this time.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.080
Postpartum depression is a far more serious condition,

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.060
affecting 1 in 7 new parents.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.600
“Baby blues” and postpartum depression

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.140
have similar symptoms.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.400
However, symptoms of “baby blues”

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.120
last about 10 days and are less intense.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.920
While postpartum depression,

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.260
the symptoms can last weeks or months,

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.860
and are more intense.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.380
Which could interfere with your

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:57.940
ability to care for your baby

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.220
and handle other daily tasks.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.420
Symptoms of postpartum depression may include:

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.580
Depressed mood or mood swings

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.120
Excessive crying

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.580
Difficulty bonding with your baby

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.720
Inability to sleep or sleeping too much

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.040

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.580

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.460
Thoughts of harming yourself or your baby

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.700
It’s OK to feel overwhelmed.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.920
Having a baby isn’t easy.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.260
If you have depression, you don’t have to suffer alone.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.000
Find someone to talk to

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.200
a therapist,

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.140
a support group for new parents,

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.440
or even a friend who will

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.460
listen to you and help you.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.220
Your healthcare provider can help

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.980
find a treatment that works for you.
