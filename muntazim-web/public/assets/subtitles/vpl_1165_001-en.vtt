00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.480
An angiogram is a test to see if your arteries are narrowed or blocked.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.180
An Angiogram uses fluoroscopy,

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.040
essentially a “movie x-ray,” to view your arteries.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.500
An angiogram can be done for blood vessels

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.780
anywhere in your body. 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.100
Your healthcare provider will carefully guide

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.980
a long thin tube called a catheter to the problem area.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.980
A special dye called contrast

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.980
is introduced into your vessels.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.140
As the contrast fills your arteries,

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.920
they become visible on x-ray,

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.960
revealing areas of narrowing or blockage.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.820
A cardiac angiogram, or cardiac catheterization,

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.060
looks at your heart arteries.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.920
An aortic angiogram

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.720
outlines your chest and abdominal blood vessels.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.720
A carotid angiogram

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.820
looks at the arteries in your neck.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.360
A renal angiogram

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.440
looks at the blood vessels to the kidneys.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.820
And leg, iliac or groin, and popliteal

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.700
or lower leg angiograms

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.020
look at your upper and lower leg.
