00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:02.660
An electric system transmits

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:04.090
signals throughout the heart

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:05.660
to control its pumping.

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.870
The electrical signal begins

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.260
in the sinoatrial or SA node.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.160
Located in the upper portion

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.550
of the right, upper chamber,

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:14.620
or atrium,

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.130
it is known as the heartâ€™s

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:17.780
natural pacemaker.

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.490
The electrical signal

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.430
passes down to the ventricles,

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.140
the lower chambers of the heart

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.110
via the atrioventricular

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:26.510
or AV node.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.630
This controls the signals

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.390
so the atria contract

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.040
before the ventricles.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.380
Pathways carry the signal throughout

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.080
the muscles of the ventricle

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.380
so that they contract at the same time

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.030
pump blood to the lungs

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.291
and through the body.
