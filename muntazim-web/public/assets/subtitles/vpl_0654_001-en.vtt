00:00:00.272 --> 00:00:03.528
Gingivitis means inflammation of the gums.

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.952
It most commonly develops in response

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:07.984
to the biofilm called plaque,

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.008
which is made up of bacteria.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.384
When the plaque is allowed to build up,

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.056
it attracts more types of bacteria.

00:00:15.144 --> 00:00:17.640
Over time, it hardens at the base of

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.952
the teeth into a material called tartar.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.992
The plaque and tartar irritate the gums. 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.632
The immune system sends white blood cells

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.216
to fight the bacteria,

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.856
and the gums become inflamed.

00:00:30.976 --> 00:00:32.928
Active inflammation may contribute

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.896
to formation of clots in blood vessels.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.344
Bacteria entering the blood stream

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.688
activate platelets and increase clotting factors,

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.528
which work with platelets to form blood clots.
