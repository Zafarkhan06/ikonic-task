00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.664
The testes are egg-shaped

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:02.976
glands in the scrotum that

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.464
produce male sex hormones and sperm.

00:00:05.632 --> 00:00:07.232
Most testicular cancers

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.656
begin in germ cells,

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.576
which produce immature sperm.

00:00:10.752 --> 00:00:12.688
Why germ cells become abnormal and

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.640
develop cancer is not known.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.288
Testicular cancer is usually diagnosed

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.880
because a man or his doctor

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.952
has found a hard lump on the testicle.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.624
It is usually painless unless

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.216
the cancer has advanced.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.936
Treatment depends on the type

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.360
and stage of cancer.

00:00:27.512 --> 00:00:30.400
There are two main types of testicular cancer:

00:00:30.496 --> 00:00:33.016
seminomas and nonseminomas.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.640
Seminomas are generally less aggressive

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.984
than nonseminomas,

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.640
which are more likely to develop

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.552
early in life and grow and spread rapidly.

00:00:41.752 --> 00:00:43.784
Stage I testicular cancer

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.544
is limited to the testis.

00:00:45.672 --> 00:00:47.376
Stage II has spread to

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.112
the lymph nodes in the abdomen.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.152
And Stage III has spread to

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:52.536
other parts of the body.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.240
Testicular cancer is highly treatable,

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.616
even when it has spread beyond the testicle.

00:00:57.688 --> 00:01:00.320
Primary treatment is removal of the testicle,

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.808
and sometimes the lymph nodes in the groin.

00:01:02.968 --> 00:01:04.488
Seminomas may also be

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.992
treated with radiation.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.712
Chemotherapy may be used

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.040
along with surgery.

00:01:09.112 --> 00:01:10.920
Regular self-examination of the

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.584
testes can help to identify

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.984
cancer early at its earliest stages.
