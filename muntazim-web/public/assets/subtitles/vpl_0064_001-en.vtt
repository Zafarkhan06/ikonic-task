00:00:00.528 --> 00:00:02.192
A normal heartbeat begins with

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.704
a group of specialized pacemaker cells

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.512
called the sinoatrial node

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:07.520
in the heartâ€™s upper,

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.320
right chamber, or atrium.

00:00:09.648 --> 00:00:11.632
Regular electrical impulses

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:12.600
from these cells

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.776
cause the atria to

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.600
contract or squeeze,

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.128
pushing blood into the lower

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.008
chambers or ventricles.

00:00:19.184 --> 00:00:20.864
Traveling down to a junction

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.496
called the atrioventricular,

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:23.936
or AV node and on

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.160
to the ventricles,

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.608
these impulses then

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.904
signal the ventricles to contract.

00:00:29.072 --> 00:00:31.112
This pumps blood out to the lungs

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:32.624
and the rest of the body.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.280
Heat block means

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.040
these electrical impulses

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.728
canâ€™t pass from the atria

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.056
to the ventricles.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.248
As a result,

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.096
the contractions of these chambers

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.936
may not be coordinated,

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.328
which can cause a very

00:00:45.336 --> 00:00:46.870
slow heart rate.
