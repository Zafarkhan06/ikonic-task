00:00:00.784 --> 00:00:02.800
Skin resurfacing refers to

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.344
any procedure that removes

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.112
the top layer of the skin

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.016
so that it is replaced by new,

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.328
healthier, smoother-looking skin.

00:00:10.784 --> 00:00:12.816
Resurfacing improves the health

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:14.352
and appearance of skin that is

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:16.624
scarred or damaged by acne,

00:00:16.624 --> 00:00:18.620
the sun, or chemicals.

00:00:18.848 --> 00:00:20.808
In microdermabrasion,

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.328
tiny crystals polish the skin

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.880
for an overall fresh,

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.448
healthy-looking glow.

00:00:26.688 --> 00:00:28.744
Any skin resurfacing procedure

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.048
achieves smoother, younger-looking skin

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.608
with fewer wrinkles.

00:00:32.832 --> 00:00:34.880
Regular use of moisturizers

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.712
and lotions containing lanolin,

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:37.968
a natural oil,

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.408
and no fragrances,

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.544
helps to keep skin youthful.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.464
The effects of skin resurfacing

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.864
can last from months to years.
