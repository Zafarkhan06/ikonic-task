00:00:00.368 --> 00:00:02.608
Most of the food we eat turns into

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.680
glucose or sugar for fuel.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.040
Digested food moves from the gut

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.264
into blood vessels so it can travel

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.104
to all parts of the body.

00:00:11.416 --> 00:00:13.208
A hormone called insulin

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.280
“unlocks” cells so that glucose from the blood

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.520
can enter cells throughout your body

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.520
where it serves as fuel.

00:00:20.688 --> 00:00:22.872
Insulin is produced by the pancreas

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.816
when glucose levels in the blood increase.

00:00:26.168 --> 00:00:28.632
In diabetes, there are problems with

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.336
how insulin is made or works.

00:00:31.456 --> 00:00:33.232
When insulin does not move

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.544
glucose from blood into cells,

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.784
blood sugar levels stay high

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.624
while your cells cannot get enough fuel.

00:00:40.776 --> 00:00:43.544
There are 2 main types of diabetes.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.272
In type 1, the pancreas does not make insulin

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.432
and a person must take insulin to stay alive.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.200
In type 2, the most common type,

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.344
either the pancreas does not make enough insulin

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.160
or it is not effective at moving sugar into cells.
