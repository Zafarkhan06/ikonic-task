00:00:00.192 --> 00:00:02.992
Your knee has four major ligaments.

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:04.400
The knee ligament called

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.392
the anterior cruciate ligament,

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:07.624
or ACL,

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.016
connects the thighbone, or femur,

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.184
to the shinbone, or tibia.

00:00:12.304 --> 00:00:14.816
An ACL that is severely torn

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:17.904
may be surgically reconstructed with a graft,

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.744
so that your thigh and shinbones are

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.880
connected with ligaments or tendons

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.256
taken from another part of your leg.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:25.728
To do the procedure,

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.024
the torn ACL is removed

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.648
and the graft is attached

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.384
through holes the surgeon drills

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.520
in the thighbone and shinbone.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.928
After the graft is passed through the holes,

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.880
it is held in place with screws

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.504
or other devices.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.328
Incisions in your skin are closed

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.768
with stitches, tape or staples.
