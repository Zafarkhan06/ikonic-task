00:00:00.488 --> 00:00:02.720
Blood pressure is the force of your blood

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.928
pushing against the walls of your arteries.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.168
High blood pressure, or hypertension,

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.360
is a condition in which the force of blood

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.888
against the arteries is more than normal.

00:00:12.016 --> 00:00:13.584
High blood pressure can lead to

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.704
serious health conditions including,

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.400
heart disease, stroke, kidney damage and eye problems. 

00:00:19.584 --> 00:00:21.136
Your blood pressure measurement

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.944
is made up of two numbers.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.560
The top number, called the systolic reading,

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.048
is a measure of the pressure in your arteries

00:00:28.048 --> 00:00:30.128
when your heart beats, or contracts.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.528
A normal systolic pressure is below 120.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.344
The bottom number, called the diastolic reading,

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.360
is the pressure in your arteries

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.504
when your heart rests between beats.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.464
A normal diastolic blood pressure

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:43.840
is lower than 80. 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.232
Usually, high blood pressure is defined

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.816
as blood pressure above 130/80.

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.008
Getting your blood pressure checked regularly

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.400
will help identify any pressure changes

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.144
or potential problems.
