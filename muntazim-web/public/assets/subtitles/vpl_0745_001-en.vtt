00:00:00.408 --> 00:00:02.360
Most coronary artery stents

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.168
are placed through the femoral artery

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.256
in the inner thigh.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.424
The catheter carrying the stent

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.608
is advanced through the circulatory system

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.968
to the heart and into the blocked coronary artery.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.592
Another common approach

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.088
is through the radial artery in the wrist.

00:00:17.304 --> 00:00:20.504
In this approach, the catheter is passed up the arm

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.920
and into the blocked coronary artery.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.800
Once in the coronary artery,

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.960
radiopaque dye is used to verify

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.928
the stent is positioned correctly in the blockage.

00:00:30.264 --> 00:00:32.384
A balloon in the catheter is inflated

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.280
to open the blocked artery.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.760
The stent is pushed out

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.536
to hold the artery open.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.032
The balloon is deflated

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.752
and the catheter is removed,

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.744
leaving the stent in place.
