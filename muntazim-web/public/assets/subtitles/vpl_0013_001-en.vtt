00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.140
After access to the damaged joint,

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.700
knee replacement surgery begins

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.730
with removal of damaged cartilage and bone

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.400
and shaping the lower end of the thighbone,

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.570
also called the distal femur.

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.330
Shaping the distal femoral bone

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:18.320
insures that your leg maintains

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.680
proper alignment with the new joint

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.450
and prepares it for attachment

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.970
of a new, metal joint component.
