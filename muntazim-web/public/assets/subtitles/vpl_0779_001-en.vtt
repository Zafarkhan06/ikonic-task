00:00:01.368 --> 00:00:03.944
Ankle fractures may include breaks to

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.096
any of the three bones that make up the ankle joint.

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.832
The ends of the calf bone, or fibula,

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:11.856
and shinbone, or tibia,

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.864
are the most common sites for ankle fractures;

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.744
but the ankle bone, or talus, may also be broken.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.120
Fractures commonly occur when the ankle is rolled

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.200
either to the inside or the outside.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.592
They may also be caused by twisting the ankle,

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.000
falling on it in an awkward manor,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.256
or blunt trauma such as that which 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.240
may be experienced during a car accident.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.888
The most common type of ankle fracture

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.072
involves the lateral malleolus or end of the fibula.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.528
Fractures to the medial malleolus

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.136
or inside part of the tibia, are less common.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.384
If both the tibia and fibula are broken,

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.256
it is called a bimalleolar fracture.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.920
A sudden forceful twisting of the ankle

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.008
may lead to a trimalleolar fracture.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.848
A trimalleolar fracture refers to 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.184
fractures of the end of the fibula,

00:01:06.248 --> 00:01:07.896
the lateral malleolus,

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.496
as well as two separate fractures to the

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.976
inside and back of the tibia

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.344
or medial malleolus.
