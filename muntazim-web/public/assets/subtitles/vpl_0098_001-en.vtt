00:00:00.456 --> 00:00:01.864
The bones that make up the

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.000
spinal column are called vertebrae,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.584
They are also named for their locations.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.032
The cervical vertebrae are in the neck,

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.712
the thoracic vertebrae are in the upper back,

00:00:12.848 --> 00:00:15.816
and the lumbar vertebrae are in the lower back.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.464
The bones at the bottom of your

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.512
spinal column called the

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:19.904
sacrum and the coccyx

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.608
make up your tailbone.

00:00:21.864 --> 00:00:23.592
Experiencing back pain

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.152
usually means you have injured

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.528
the ligaments or muscles

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.064
attached to the vertebrae,

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.528
Common causes include

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.768
twisting motions,

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.280
poor posture, and overuse.
