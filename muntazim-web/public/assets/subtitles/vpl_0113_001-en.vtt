00:00:00.496 --> 00:00:02.480
The appendix is a small pouch

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:03.720
at the site where the small

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.680
and large intestine come together.

00:00:05.872 --> 00:00:08.992
Appendicitis means the appendix is inflamed,

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.144
often because a piece of stool is blocking its opening.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.672
Common symptoms of an inflamed appendix include:

00:00:15.848 --> 00:00:17.432
Pain in the abdomen starting

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.400
near the belly button

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.024
and moving to the lower right,

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.992
that gets worse when you move

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.384
lack of appetite

00:00:23.544 --> 00:00:25.160
nausea and vomiting

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.520
mild fever

00:00:26.832 --> 00:00:28.656
An inflamed appendix usually

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.000
needs to be removed.

00:00:30.168 --> 00:00:31.520
This surgical procedure,

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.104
called an appendectomy,

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.000
can be done through tiny cuts

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.224
or one larger cut

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.168
in the lower right side of the belly.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.592
A tool that cuts tissue and stops

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.000
bleeding is used to remove the appendix.

00:00:43.176 --> 00:00:45.688
If the appendix has burst or ruptured,

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.424
a tube may be put in the abdomen

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.112
for a few days so the infection can drain.
