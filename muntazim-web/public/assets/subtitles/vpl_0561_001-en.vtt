00:00:00.296 --> 00:00:02.568
Dental plaque is a biofilm

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.040
formed from bacteria in your mouth.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.128
It starts to form within a couple of

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.536
minutes on a freshly polished tooth.

00:00:09.688 --> 00:00:11.936
Once the bacteria stick to teeth,

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.712
they bind to other bacteria in your mouth.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.752
The larger the mass of bacteria becomes,

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.248
the more bacteria it can hold onto

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.568
and the thicker the plaque becomes. 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.384
When you brush your teeth,

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.640
you disrupt the biofilm and

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.344
colonies of microbes,

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.632
and the process begins again.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.088
Anywhere the plaque is not removed,

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.960
the bacteria mass continues to grow

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.672
and the more complicated the mix of bacteria becomes. 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.856
The bacteria in plaque produce

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.536
acid from carbohydrates in your mouth,

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.936
which eats away at tooth enamel

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.424
Calcium, phosphorous, and fluoride molecules in your saliva

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.256
replace the minerals lost from your teeth by acid.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.496
But over time, more minerals are lost

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.176
than can be replaced.

00:01:00.176 --> 00:01:02.170
Enamel is worn away,

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.288
and tartar begins to form.
