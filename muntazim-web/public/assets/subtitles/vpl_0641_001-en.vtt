00:00:02.104 --> 00:00:04.392
Upper respiratory symptoms from flu

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.712
and colds can be very uncomfortable.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.768
The most common cause of colds and flu

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.720
is the rhinovirus, which lives in nasal passages.

00:00:13.928 --> 00:00:15.776
It enters through the nostrils and

00:00:15.776 --> 00:00:17.770
passes to the back of the nose,

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.560
where it invades cells lining the upper area of the throat.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.736
Runny nose and sinus congestion are

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.472
responses to a rhinovirus invasion.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.544
Nasal drainage increases

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.032
as your body tries to get rid of the virus.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.544
Inflammation and increased blood flow

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.144
to sinonasal tissues cause sinus congestion.

00:00:37.776 --> 00:00:40.280
Saline irrigation can help to relieve

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.704
these symptoms in multiple ways.

00:00:42.936 --> 00:00:45.080
It cleans mucus from your nose,

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.536
which can also help make nasally

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.840
administered medications more effective.

00:00:49.336 --> 00:00:51.976
Other benefits include reducing swelling;

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:53.624
increasing airflow;

00:00:53.904 --> 00:00:57.208
removing bacteria and viruses from your nose;

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.440
and decreasing production of proteins

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.440
associated with inflammation.

00:01:01.776 --> 00:01:04.272
Saline irrigation also moistens

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.120
tiny hair like structures called cilia,

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.456
helping them pass bacteria and viruses to the throat

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.928
to be swallowed without causing harm.
