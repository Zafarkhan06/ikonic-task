00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720
Not training, diet or equipment.

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.120
The difference is genetic.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.304
When scientists studied the composition

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.056
of sprintersâ€™ leg muscles,

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.720
they found more specialized fibers

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.432
which are capable of contracting

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:14.896
ten times faster

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:16.896
than other muscle fibers.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.984
In a typical, healthy adult

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.144
these fast fibers comprise about

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.136
half of all muscle fibers.
