00:00:01.928 --> 00:00:04.168
Asthma is caused by inflammation,

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.168
or swelling

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.768
of the lining of the airways

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.472
in your childâ€™s lungs.

00:00:09.104 --> 00:00:10.688
In a child with asthma,

00:00:10.944 --> 00:00:12.312
the lining of the airways is

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.208
always a little inflamed

00:00:14.504 --> 00:00:16.664
but when exposed to an infection,

00:00:16.896 --> 00:00:19.048
irritants such as cold air,

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.128
chemicals, perfume or smoke,

00:00:21.208 --> 00:00:23.672
or allergens like dust or pollen,

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.088
the lining of the airways swell.

00:00:26.224 --> 00:00:27.936
The airways contract

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.864
and produce more mucus.

00:00:30.384 --> 00:00:32.016
These changes in the airway make

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:33.216
it difficult for your child

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.304
to move air in

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.040
or out of the lungs.
