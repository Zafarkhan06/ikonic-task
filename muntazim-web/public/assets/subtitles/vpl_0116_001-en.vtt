00:00:00.192 --> 00:00:02.448
Benign prostatic hyperplasia,

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.096
or BPH,

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:05.488
refers to enlargement

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.000
of the prostate gland.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.904
This gland is part of a manâ€™s

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.200
reproductive system

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.304
and makes the fluid that

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.200
nourishes and carries sperm.

00:00:13.792 --> 00:00:15.464
The prostate gland is located

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:16.992
between the base of the bladder

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:18.696
and the beginning of the penis.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.424
It surrounds the upper part

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:21.472
of the urethra,

00:00:21.576 --> 00:00:23.064
the passageway for urine

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.448
from the bladder out through the penis.

00:00:25.592 --> 00:00:27.320
BPH often begins

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.704
after age 40.

00:00:28.976 --> 00:00:30.720
The enlarging prostate can put

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.232
pressure on the urethra,

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.696
and interfere with normal urination.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.272
Problems can include:

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.048
a weak stream of urine

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.880
trouble starting or maintaining

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:40.984
the urine stream

00:00:41.176 --> 00:00:43.128
leaking or dribbling urine

00:00:43.304 --> 00:00:45.584
a feeling that the bladder is not empty

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.144
frequent or sudden need to urinate

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.640
blood in the urine

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.072
sudden inability to urinate

00:00:52.456 --> 00:00:54.176
If you have BPH,

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.816
your doctor may prescribe medicine

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.080
to stop the prostate from growing larger

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.200
or to relax muscles in the bladder,

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.216
urethra, and prostate.

00:01:02.768 --> 00:01:05.528
BPH is sometimes treated with surgery

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.256
through the urethra or the lower

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.472
abdomen to remove prostate tissue

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.976
that is putting excess pressure on the urethra.
