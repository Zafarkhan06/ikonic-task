00:00:00.368 --> 00:00:04.040
Low anterior resection or LAR,

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.008
is a surgery used to treat certain cancers of the rectum.

00:00:08.352 --> 00:00:10.456
This surgery is used when the cancer is

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.120
located sufficiently high enough in your rectum

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.096
so the anal sphincter muscles can be spared.

00:00:16.392 --> 00:00:19.816
This allows you to have bowel movements in the usual way.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.872
Your surgeon will remove the 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.432
part of your rectum containing the cancer.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.608
Then the remaining part of your rectum

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.928
is reconnected to your colon.

00:00:29.448 --> 00:00:31.768
The spot where the two ends are attached

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.264
is called an anastomosis.

00:00:34.832 --> 00:00:37.960
In some cases, a temporary illeostomy

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.592
may be needed to allow time 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.208
for the anastomosis to fully heal.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.896
Your surgeon will bring part of your small intestine

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.584
out to a small opening on your abdomen.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.848
This creates a new site on your abdomen called a stoma.

00:00:53.384 --> 00:00:56.184
Stool will leave your body through the stoma

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.824
and collect in an ostomy pouch.

00:00:59.336 --> 00:01:02.104
A temporary illeostomy is usually closed

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.704
a few months after your initial surgery.
