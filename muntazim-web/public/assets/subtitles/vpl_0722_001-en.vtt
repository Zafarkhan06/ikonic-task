00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.816
The abdominal wall is a sheet of muscle and tendon

00:00:02.816 --> 00:00:04.810
extending from the ribs to the groin.

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:07.656
It holds and protects the contents of the abdomen.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.432
A hernia is an area of weakness in the wall

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:12.176
that allows fat or organs

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.376
to push through, causing a bulge.

00:00:14.544 --> 00:00:16.712
Hernias often occur in the groin.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.056
Groin hernias are either inguinal,

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.896
meaning they occur above the inguinal ligament,

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.752
or femoral, occurring below this ligament.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.416
Some inguinal hernias

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.344
occur when the inguinal canal

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.912
the pathway for the testicles

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.312
to descend from the abdomen

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.968
in a male fetus--fails to close.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.760
These are called indirect inguinal hernias.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.384
Othersâ€”called direct inguinal hernias

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.176
result from stress on or degeneration

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.720
of abdominal muscle as a person ages.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.184
Inguinal hernias are more common in men

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.024
but may also develop in women.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.176
Femoral hernias, which occur in the

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.480
upper part of the thigh, 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.024
are more common in women.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.256
A ventral hernia, also called an incisional hernia,

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.472
occurs when scar tissue, following abdominal surgery

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.424
weakens the abdominal wall.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.648
Potential complications of hernias

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.320
include an organ pushing through

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.024
and become trapped in the hole.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.376
Digested food may become blocked.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.968
In the worst case, arteries may be pinched,

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.480
cutting off the blood supply,

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.880
and killing living tissue in the bowel or other organs.
