00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.696
A thyroidectomy is a surgery to remove

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:04.832
all or part of your thyroid.

00:00:05.088 --> 00:00:07.496
Your thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.280
in your throat that makes and stores hormones.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.096
Your thyroid’s main role is to

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.720
help control your metabolism.

00:00:13.912 --> 00:00:15.824
Depending on the reason for your surgery, 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.528
you may have all or part

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.960
of your thyroid removed.

00:00:19.096 --> 00:00:21.360
A partial thyroidectomy removes

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.432
part of your thyroid.

00:00:22.536 --> 00:00:23.808
 This may be done if you have a

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.672
non-cancerous tumor on

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.640
only one side of your thyroid.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.136
The part of your thyroid that is

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.416
left behind should still work.

00:00:33.544 --> 00:00:35.600
A subtotal thyroidectomy

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.952
removes most of your thyroid tissue.

00:00:38.072 --> 00:00:40.376
This may be done if you have an overactive

00:00:40.376 --> 00:00:42.370
or enlarged thyroid.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.000
A small amount of thyroid tissue may be left behind.

00:00:46.384 --> 00:00:48.000
A total thyroidectomy

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.320
removes your entire thyroid gland.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.136
This procedure is performed if 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:53.848
non-cancerous tumors have spread

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.536
throughout your thyroid or

00:00:55.536 --> 00:00:57.530
if they have become cancerous.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.544
If your entire thyroid is removed,

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.536
you will need hormone replacement medicine

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.144
for the rest of your life.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.328
Before surgery, follow your doctor’s directions

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.704
for eating, drinking and taking medicine.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.672
You probably won't be able to eat

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.224
or drink anything after midnight

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.496
before your surgery.

00:01:13.952 --> 00:01:17.152
During surgery, you will be under general anesthesia,

00:01:17.152 --> 00:01:19.150
asleep and pain-free.

00:01:19.328 --> 00:01:21.624
Surgery may take two hours or more.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.560
Depending on the reasons for your

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.008
surgery and your surgeon,

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.440
you may have a conventional thyroidectomy

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.928
that uses a horizontal incision in the front of your neck;

00:01:31.408 --> 00:01:33.544
an endoscopic thyroidectomy that

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.248
uses several small incisions in the neck;

00:01:37.712 --> 00:01:41.120
or robotic thyroidectomy that uses incisions

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.112
in the chest and armpit or high in the neck.

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.008
Follow your doctor’s instructions for 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.584
bathing and taking care of your incision after your surgery.

00:01:50.368 --> 00:01:52.920
Your incision should heal within a couple of weeks.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.872
Talk with your doctor about how you

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.680
can reduce and heal your scar.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.976
And if you experience any voice changes.
