The bones of the face have

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.712
hollow spaces called sinuses.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.710
A cold or allergies

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:08.696
can cause these openings to become

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:10.704
blocked by swollen tissue lining

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:11.776
the sinuses

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.704
or congestion due to excess mucus.

00:00:15.008 --> 00:00:16.592
Swelling and congestion

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:17.800
can cause pressure,

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.512
resulting in sinus headaches

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:20.976
and facial pain.
