00:00:00.448 --> 00:00:02.984
To understand how we visibly age,

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:04.328
it helps to understand

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.096
the anatomy of the skin.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.776
Two features many people recognize

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:11.552
are hair follicles and sweat glands.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.648
The outer or superficial layer

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.080
of the skin is called the epidermis.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.944
Underneath that, shown here in brown,

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.440
is the dermis.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.184
The epidermis contains elastin,

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.872
which gives young skin elasticity

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.744
and enables it to quickly recover its shape.

00:00:28.968 --> 00:00:30.056
The sweat glands,

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.192
which contain and release moisture,

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:34.512
are also important for youthful skin,

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.352
as is the blood supply.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.968
But a lot of unprotected sun exposure

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.296
even when you’re young

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.264
can dry out the skin.

00:00:42.488 --> 00:00:43.904
Surface cracks allow

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.952
even more moisture to escape.

00:00:46.032 --> 00:00:49.144
And damaged skin produces less elastin,

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.552
 which contributes to wrinkle formation.

00:00:52.064 --> 00:00:54.944
Using the right kind of sun block or sunscreen

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.416
can help to prevent further damage.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.024
The sun gives off several kinds of rays,

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.728
including UVA and UVB.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.008
Both can damage skin.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.952
The skin on the left is protected from both,

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.416
but the skin on the right

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.000
is not protected against UVAs,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.672
which continue to damage tissues.

00:01:14.984 --> 00:01:17.288
This prompts cells in the epidermis

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.872
to release melanin,

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.568
which darkens the skin.

00:01:20.784 --> 00:01:23.432
A lot of exposure results in sunburn,

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.960
which causes the release of

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.424
more melanin to protect the skin

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.328
and leads to sun spots and freckles.

00:01:30.448 --> 00:01:32.432
Using the wrong kinds of soaps

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.144
can also age skin

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.552
by stripping away the thin protective

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.136
coating called the acid mantle.

00:01:39.224 --> 00:01:42.720
Cigarette smoke promotes skin cracks and wrinkles

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.816
because it reduces levels of nitric oxide,

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.976
a cellular gas that helps keep skin flexible

00:01:49.296 --> 00:01:51.896
Many women use an exfoliating agent

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.984
to debride or scrape off dead skin cells.

00:01:55.152 --> 00:01:56.980
Some agents become smaller

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.808
or dissolve as they’re used,

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.560
which can help prevent overuse or damage

00:02:01.624 --> 00:02:03.176
while still leaving young,

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.544
healthy material.

00:02:04.776 --> 00:02:07.080
Hydration is also important;

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.592
ideally, the solution will penetrate

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.856
the pores and keep them small

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.688
while also plumping up the epidermis.
