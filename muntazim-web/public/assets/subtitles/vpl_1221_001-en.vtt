00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:05.740
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD,

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.780
is one of the most common mental disorders

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:10.780
affecting children and can continue as an adult.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.780
An estimated 8.4% of children

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.500
and 2.5% of adults have ADHD.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.880
It’s usually identified in children first

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.880
because of disruptions in classrooms

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.040
and problems with school assignments.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.980
To understand ADHD,

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.200
you first have to understand the 3 main types:

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.860
Hyperactive/Impulsive,

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:31.980
Inattentive,

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.500
and Combined.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.620
The Hyperactive/Impulsive type

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:36.840
is the least common

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.880
and may show signs of an inability to sit still,

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.100
excess energy,

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.320
and can be extremely talkative.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.820
Often interrupting others

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.760
and acting without thinking.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.260
Inattentive type will struggle more

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.160
with maintaining attention and focus,

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.280
will often have difficulty following detailed directions,

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.140
and will struggle to listen.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.920
Someone with Inattentive type

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.640
may always look like they’re daydreaming.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.300
The Combined type is the most common

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.360
and is a mixture of all the symptoms

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.240
and meets the criteria for both

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.460
Hyperactive/Impulsive and Inattentive types.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.720
Someone diagnosed with combined type

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.040
will likely experience hyperactivity and impulsivity,

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.540
while also struggling with

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.920
inattention and distractibility.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.480
It may be difficult for them to

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.520
concentrate in class or at work,

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.560
and they will likely struggle with self-control.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.380
To be diagnosed with a type of ADHD

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.560
a child up to the age of 16

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.000
must have at least 6 symptoms.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.220
If you are 17 or older,

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.400
you must have at least 5 symptoms.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.080
And symptoms must be present

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.940
for at least 6 months.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.980
If you or your child has been diagnosed with ADHD,

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.540
the most important thing to know

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.780
is that treatment for ADHD works.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.160
Treatment usually involves a combination

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.960
of behavioral therapy and medication.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.240
Behavioral therapy will build skills

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.740
to minimize distractions,

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.800
increase structure and organization,

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.240
and garner support from family members.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.780
ADHD medicine,

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.720
usually in the form of stimulants,

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.700
will help with focus and attention.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.780
If you suspect that you or someone you know

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.320
might have ADHD,

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.320
talk with a healthcare provider,

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.020
who will perform an evaluation

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.220
and discuss treatment options.
