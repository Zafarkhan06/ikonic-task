00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:04.656
Nasal allergies, also called allergic rhinitis,

00:00:04.664 --> 00:00:05.840
are very common.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.176
As you breathe,

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.232
allergens, such as pollen, mold spores, or animal dander,

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.160
cause your body to release chemicals

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.064
that create a collection of symptoms,

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.704
mostly involving the eyes and nose. 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.848
Many people with allergic rhinitis

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.936
also have other nasal and sinus symptoms.

00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:25.352
Drainage from the nose and sinuses can make

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.992
rhinitis worse, especially at night.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.272
In a recent survey, almost 90% of family physicians

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.824
recommended nasal saline irrigation

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.200
for sinus and nasal symptoms.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.840
A salt-water nasal wash,

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.592
or saline irrigation,

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.880
helps to clean mucus from your nose,

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.440
decrease nasal swelling,

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.336
and increase air flow.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.600
It can also rinse allergens or

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.080
pollen from your nose

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.440
and make nasally administered medications more effective.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.168
Regular nasal irrigation helps remove

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.712
bacteria and viruses from the nose,

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.488
which reduces the potential for infection.

00:01:02.688 --> 00:01:06.720
It also moistens tiny hair like structures called cilia.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.184
They pass allergens and other invaders

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.064
like bacteria to the throat 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.408
to be swallowed without causing harm.
