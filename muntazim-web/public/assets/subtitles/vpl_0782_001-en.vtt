00:00:00.344 --> 00:00:02.688
Colorectal cancer is the term used for

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:04.528
cancer that starts in the colon

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.872
(large intestine) or rectum.

00:00:07.032 --> 00:00:08.456
In the United States,

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:10.576
colorectal cancer is the third most

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.064
common type of cancer

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.960
that is diagnosed in both men and women.

00:00:15.336 --> 00:00:17.696
An abdominoperineal resection,

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.584
or APR, is a surgical procedure to remove the rectum.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.568
The procedure is used to treat 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.152
certain rectal and anal cancers.

00:00:27.496 --> 00:00:29.928
Your surgeon will remove your anus,

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.544
rectum and part of your sigmoid colon

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.032
along with associated blood vessels and lymph nodes.

00:00:36.136 --> 00:00:37.856
The portion of your colon removed 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.896
contains the cancerous tissue.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.240
Your anus is permanently closed with sutures.

00:00:43.544 --> 00:00:45.560
A colostomy will then be performed

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.584
to bring the healthy end of your colon

00:00:47.592 --> 00:00:49.424
to the surface of your abdomen.

00:00:49.872 --> 00:00:53.712
This creates a new site on your abdomen called a stoma,

00:00:53.912 --> 00:00:55.928
where stool leaves the body

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.568
and collects in an ostomy pouch.
