00:00:00.188 --> 00:00:01.360
AIDS is caused by

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:03.206
infection with a virus called

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.493
the Human Immunodeficiency Virus

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:06.448
type 1

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.264
or HIV 1.

00:00:08.456 --> 00:00:10.672
This virus has an outer envelope,

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:11.656
or membrane

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.440
covered in spikes made of the proteins

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.264
Just below is a layer

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.304
called the matrix or capsid.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.432
The capsid covers the components

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.208
needed for replication.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.656
These include 3 enzymes

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.752
called reverse transcriptase,

00:00:26.824 --> 00:00:27.888
integrase,

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.272
and protease

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:30.328
and 2 strands of

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.032
ribonucleic acid or RNA,

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.200
which carry genetic information.

00:00:35.768 --> 00:00:37.968
HIV 1 infects cells

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.368
of the immune system,

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.056
such as helper T cells

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.528
and macrophages,

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.504
These cells are critical

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.528
for fighting off viral invasion

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.768
and infection.

00:00:48.048 --> 00:00:50.320
Spikes on the surface of the virus

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.800
attach to receptors

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.152
on the target cell.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.536
Once docked,

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.456
the virus's inner capsid

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.416
enters the target cell.

00:00:59.008 --> 00:01:00.984
The viruses outer membrane

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.872
Is left behind as part of the

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.912
target cellular membrane.

00:01:05.072 --> 00:01:06.520
Inside the cell

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.016
the viral capsid dissolves.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.024
This releases the virus's

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.960
reverse transcriptase and RNA.

00:01:14.064 --> 00:01:15.664
Reverse transcriptase

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.304
Creates a circular sequence

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.640
of viral DNA

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.624
from the viral RNA.

00:01:20.824 --> 00:01:23.200
The new segment of viral DNA

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.752
Is taken through a pore

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.856
in the target cell's nucleus

00:01:26.856 --> 00:01:28.850
to reach it's DNA.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.656
The viral DNA is then

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.656
spliced into the target cell DNA.

00:01:34.032 --> 00:01:35.576
Target cell mechanisms

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.616
create messenger RNA

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.144
which serves as a template

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.112
for viral proteins.

00:01:41.192 --> 00:01:43.744
Ribosomes produce these proteins

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.160
after messenger RNA leaves the nucleus.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.120
They form new viral RNA strands

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.520
which float through the cellular space,

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.656
join with vital enzymes

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.480
and are encapsulated near the

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.224
target cell surface.

00:01:58.288 --> 00:02:00.424
They bud from the cell surface,

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.920
with an envelope formed

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.904
from the host cell membrane.

00:02:04.128 --> 00:02:06.104
As many as 10 billion

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.072
HIV virus particles

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:09.528
are produced a day

00:02:09.528 --> 00:02:11.264
in an infected person.
