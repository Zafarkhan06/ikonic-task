00:00:00.352 --> 00:00:01.992
An ingrown hair occurs

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:03.560
when a hair that has been plucked,

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.144
waxed or shaved grows back

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:07.896
into the skin sideways

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.504
or curls down back into the skin.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.832
As the hair curls underneath the surface

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.560
of the skin irritation and an infection may occur.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.032
The skin becomes red and inflamed

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:21.928
and pus can build up in the affected area.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.856
Ingrown hairs usually arenâ€™t serious.

00:00:24.856 --> 00:00:26.850
They can appear anywhere on the body,

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.936
though they are most common in the beard,

00:00:28.936 --> 00:00:30.930
legs and pubic region.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.496
Teens and younger adults tend to experience

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.048
more frequent problems

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.096
as do populations with tightly curled hair.

00:00:38.224 --> 00:00:41.408
Treatments and remedies for ingrown hairs include:

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.744
Applying a warm washcloth over the ingrown hair,

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.632
particularly before shaving.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.656
Shaving in a different direction.

00:00:48.752 --> 00:00:50.768
Avoiding waxing or shaving

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.696
until the infections clears up.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.136
Application of a topical ointment.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.568
Application of antibiotics.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.704
Using a sterile needle to lift

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.360
and free any loops of hair

00:01:01.384 --> 00:01:03.064
embedded under the skin.
