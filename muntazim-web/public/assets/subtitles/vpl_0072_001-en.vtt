Your skin makes its own protection when

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:05.552
oil glands produce natural oils.

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:07.768
These oils are removed by soaps

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.576
which can make the skin drier.

00:00:09.888 --> 00:00:11.816
Dry skin may be itchy

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:14.368
with flaking, peeling, and scaling.

00:00:14.576 --> 00:00:17.480
Regular use of unscented moisturizers

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.400
 and lotions helps to treat mild symptoms.

00:00:20.512 --> 00:00:23.640
The most effective, least expensive lotions

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.912
contain lanolin, a natural oil,

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.584
and no fragrances.
