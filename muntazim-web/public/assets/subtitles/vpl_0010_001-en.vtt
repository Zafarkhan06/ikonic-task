00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.560
If you have heart failure,

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.380
 your heart cannot pump enough blood

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.090
to meet your bodyâ€™s needs.

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:09.490
To compensate,

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.780
your body retains water and salt,

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.570
which increases the amount of blood in circulation.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.570
The heart beats faster,

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.360
and your heart muscle gets bigger,

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.300
causing your heart to wear out.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.770
The extra fluid buildup in your body,

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:24.130
called congestion,

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.770
and the overworked heart

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.020
lead to congestive heart failure.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.570
Common symptoms of heart failure include

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.770
shortness of breath,

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.020
fatigue,

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.140
coughing,

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.930
and swelling due to build up of fluids.
