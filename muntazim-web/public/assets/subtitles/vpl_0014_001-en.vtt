00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.540
Your thyroid is a small gland

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:04.170
shaped like a bow tie

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.890
 located in the front of your neck

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:07.520
below your Adamâ€™s apple.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.490
It wraps around your windpipe or trachea,

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:12.400
with lobes on either side,

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.690
joined by a bridge called an isthmus,

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.180
which crosses over the front of the windpipe.

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.360
Using iodine from the food you eat,

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.430
the thyroid produces hormones

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.190
that regulate the rate at which

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.380
all the cells in your body function.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.620
Sometimes the thyroid becomes enlarged.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:31.810
There are many possible causes.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.120
An enlarged thyroid gland,

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.730
also known as a goiter,

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.850
can cause problems with breathing or swallowing

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.810
if it gets large enough to compress

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:42.640
the windpipe and esophagus,

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.800
which carries food to your stomach.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.300
Goiters are more common in women

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.860
and older adults.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.880
Treatment depends on its size,

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.280
signs and symptoms,

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.380
and the cause

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.450
and can include surgery or thyroid drugs.
