00:00:00.584 --> 00:00:03.312
Your kidneys act as a filtration system,

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:05.632
processing blood to produce waste

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:06.880
and excess fluid,

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.912
which are eliminated as urine.

00:00:09.448 --> 00:00:11.792
About 20% of the blood your heart

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.016
pumps each minute

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:14.264
enters the kidneys

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.192
through the renal arteries.

00:00:16.568 --> 00:00:18.120
Filtering blood plasma

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.640
and formation of urine

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.832
takes place in structures called nephrons.

00:00:23.392 --> 00:00:25.448
The filtering process begins when the

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.224
blood flows through a collection of

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.944
tiny blood vessels called a glomerulus,

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.504
which is within a capsule

00:00:31.504 --> 00:00:33.464
where filtered wastes collect.

00:00:33.984 --> 00:00:36.376
Waste and excess fluid pass into

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.864
tiny tubes called tubules.

00:00:39.232 --> 00:00:42.344
Valuable proteins and chemicals are recycled.

00:00:43.192 --> 00:00:44.632
In the tubules,

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.320
electrolytes such as sodium and potassium

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.288
and water that your body needs

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.128
are moved from the filter back

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.432
 into blood vessels

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.080
through a process called resorption.

00:00:55.688 --> 00:00:57.424
After resorption,

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.232
the final waste material and

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.304
excess fluid collect as urine,

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.144
which flows down the ureters

00:01:03.144 --> 00:01:05.140
from the kidneys to the bladder.

00:01:05.368 --> 00:01:07.768
Urine exits the bladder and your body

00:01:07.784 --> 00:01:09.472
via the urethra.
