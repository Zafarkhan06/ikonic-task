00:00:00.704 --> 00:00:03.080
A column of bones called vertebrae

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:04.424
make up your spine.

00:00:05.024 --> 00:00:06.312
These bones are named

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:07.784
based on their location.

00:00:08.376 --> 00:00:11.000
The cervical vertebrae are in your neck;

00:00:11.336 --> 00:00:14.040
thoracic vertebrae are in your upper back,

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.896
and the lumbar vertebrae

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:17.360
are in your lower back.

00:00:18.176 --> 00:00:21.008
Fused bones at the bottom of your spinal column

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.968
are called the sacrum and coccyx.

00:00:24.664 --> 00:00:27.392
Small, circular cushions called disks

00:00:27.392 --> 00:00:29.390
located between each vertebra,

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:30.984
act as shock absorbers

00:00:30.984 --> 00:00:32.312
when you move your back.
