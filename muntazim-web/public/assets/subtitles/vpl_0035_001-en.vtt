00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.072
Your colon is the last part

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.752
of your digestive system,

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.000
where water and salt are removed,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.640
leaving solid waste before elimination.

00:00:08.792 --> 00:00:10.424
Sigmoidoscopy

00:00:10.456 --> 00:00:11.632
is a diagnostic

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:13.112
and screening procedure

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.776
to look at the lower parts of the colon.

00:00:16.072 --> 00:00:18.016
It is performed, with a slender,

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:19.728
flexible lit tube

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.392
called a sigmoidoscope,

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.296
which is inserted into the rectum

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.240
and guided into the colon.

00:00:25.544 --> 00:00:28.104
A fiberoptic camera on the scope

00:00:28.176 --> 00:00:29.656
enables your doctor to look

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.408
at the lining for ulcers,

00:00:31.448 --> 00:00:32.776
abnormal growths,

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:33.760
inflammation,

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.344
and bleeding from the rectum

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.248
up to the descending colon.

00:00:37.592 --> 00:00:40.288
Sigmoidoscopy is used to screen

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.200
for polyps and early signs of

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.384
colon cancer

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.376
and to find the cause of problems

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.960
such as diarrhea and abdominal pain.

00:00:48.256 --> 00:00:49.816
Polyps and tissue samples

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.384
can be removed with instruments

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:53.152
inserted in the scope.
