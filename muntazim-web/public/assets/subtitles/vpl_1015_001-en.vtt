00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.560
Cholesterol is in all the cells in your body.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.700
Your body needs some cholesterol to build healthy cells,

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.580
make hormones, and make substances that help you digest foods. 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.220
Your body makes all the cholesterol it needs.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.740
Additional cholesterol in your body comes from the food you eat.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.260
Foods from animals like meat, poultry

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.760
and full-fat dairy products all contain cholesterol.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.980
Foods that are high in saturated fats,

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.360
trans fats and some tropical oils

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.600
can also trigger your body to make more cholesterol. 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.720
High cholesterol can increase your risk of 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.700
heart disease, heart attack, and stroke.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.800
There are two types of cholesterol:

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.380
LDL cholesterol, which is bad

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.540
and HDL, which is good.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.180
High levels of HDL, or good cholesterol,

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.300
seem to lower the risk of heart disease

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.340
as well as help remove other forms of

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.280
cholesterol from your bloodstream.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.120
LDL cholesterol, or bad cholesterol,

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.600
sticks to the inside of arteries

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.020
forming thick, fatty deposits. 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.220
Eventually these deposits grow,

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.340
blocking or slowing blood flow.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.580
Sometimes, those deposits can break 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.360
and form a blood clot.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.420
This blocks the artery and causes a heart attack or stroke. 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.480
High cholesterol doesnâ€™t usually have any symptoms.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.700
A blood test is the only way to detect if you have it.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.020
Dietary changes, regular exercise,

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.600
and sometimes medication can help reduce high cholesterol.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.340
If you have high cholesterol,

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.580
your doctor may prescribe statins.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.580
Statins are a class of drugs that

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.740
help lower cholesterol levels in the blood.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.260
Statins work by blocking the production of LDL,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.020
resulting in reduced LDL cholesterol levels in the blood.
