00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.624
During Week 10 of pregnancy,

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:04.744
or 8 weeks after conception,

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.008
all the vital organs are in place,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.136
along with fingers and toes.

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:10.688
The genitals are forming

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.552
and development of the skeleton is underway.

00:00:13.744 --> 00:00:16.256
The embryoâ€™s head is becoming rounder.

00:00:16.424 --> 00:00:18.912
The hands are beginning to touch the face

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.768
and the hands and feet begin to touch each other.

00:00:22.024 --> 00:00:25.272
The end of this week marks a change from the embryonic

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.312
to the fetal period of development;

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.336
that is, the transition from an embryo to a fetus.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.160
