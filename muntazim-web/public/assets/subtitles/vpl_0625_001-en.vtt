00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.480
Scientists are actively studying the brains of

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.576
people with Alzheimer’s disease

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:08.432
in the hope of being able to diagnose it earlier,

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.296
or confirm a diagnosis in someone with symptoms.

00:00:12.432 --> 00:00:14.568
One test that appears promising

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.408
is analysis of spinal fluid for protein fragments.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.360
Alzheimer’s disease produces many changes to the brain.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.120
Among these are the presence of large amounts

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.120
of what are called plaques and tangles.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.280
Plaques are formed of protein fragments called amyloid beta.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.840
The fragments accumulate and form hard

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.600
plaques between nerve cells, or neurons.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.512
Tangles are twisted fragments of a protein

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.432
called tau found inside neurons.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.320
In Alzheimer’s disease,

00:00:45.368 --> 00:00:47.528
neurons in certain parts of the brain

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.568
become damaged and die.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.504
When the nerve cells die,

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.608
fragments from the plaques and tangles

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.728
enter the cerebrospinal fluid,

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.032
which bathes the entire brain.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.528
The cerebrospinal fluid flows down into the spinal column.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.944
Samples of this fluid can be taken through a

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.368
procedure called a spinal tap.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.000
It can then be analyzed for the presence of these proteins.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.344
Another test involving brain scans and a dye

00:01:14.344 --> 00:01:16.340
to image plaque in the brain

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.024
was recently approved by the FDA.

00:01:19.152 --> 00:01:21.664
Not everyone who has these fragments,

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.176
or everyone who has plaques and tangles,

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.672
will develop Alzheimer’s disease.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.864
But these are important steps towards understanding

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.392
more about this devastating disease.
