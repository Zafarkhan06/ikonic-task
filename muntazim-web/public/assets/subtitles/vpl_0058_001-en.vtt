00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.368
Since they were introduced 60 years ago,

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.448
antibiotics have been used to treat

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.416
disease and infection caused by

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.064
the family of germs called bacteria.

00:00:10.288 --> 00:00:12.896
However, some bacteria are not killed

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:15.360
by antibiotics because they have mutations

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.872
in their DNA, or biological makeup,

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:20.368
that makes antibiotics ineffective.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.680
This drug resistance can be passed

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.720
to their offspring into other microbes

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.936
by direct transfer of DNA segments

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.408
that contains the resistance mutation.

00:00:30.088 --> 00:00:31.208
As a result,

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.928
some diseases that were once

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.648
easy to treat are becoming harder

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.464
to treat and more common.

00:00:36.824 --> 00:00:38.416
A particular concern

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.264
are bacteria resistant to more

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.856
than one antibiotic,

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.488
known as MDROâ€™s,

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.256
for Multi-Drug Resistant Organisms.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.360
Another concern is the so-called super bugs.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.968
Very common bacteria with

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.352
a scientific name of

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.208
Staphylococcus aureus,

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.504
or more commonly called Staph.

00:00:56.752 --> 00:00:59.312
These super bugs are often called MRSA

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:00.632
to indicate resistant

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.944
to methicillin antibiotics.

00:01:03.128 --> 00:01:04.784
Possible reasons for why

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.616
drug resistance develops in bacterial

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.560
DNA includes

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.776
failure to complete a full

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.152
course of antibiotics

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.816
so that some bacteria escape

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.328
after drug exposure

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.784
and inappropriate overuse of antibiotics

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.384
for viral infections, like a cold.

00:01:19.712 --> 00:01:21.440
While drug companies search

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.952
for new drugs to combat

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.720
these resistant bacteria,

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.056
hospitals and clinics are putting programs

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.080
in place to limit their spread.

00:01:29.328 --> 00:01:31.080
Some countries have imposed strict

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.064
regulations on use of drugs

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.768
and agents that kill bacteria

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.016
to slow development of

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.376
even more resistant strains.
