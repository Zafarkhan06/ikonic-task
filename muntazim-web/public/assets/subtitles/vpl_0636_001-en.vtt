00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.688
Your blood, blood vessels, and heart

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.152
make up your circulatory system.

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:06.984
Your heart pumps the blood,

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.208
which carries oxygen and nutrients

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.216
through your arteries to all the cells of your body.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.752
Your brain cells need a constant supply

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.640
of oxygen and the nutrient glucose,

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.000
which are delivered via your bloodstream.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.656
A stroke occurs when the blood supply

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.504
to brain cells is cut off

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.232
and they begin to die.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.232
In an ischemic stroke,

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.272
a blood clot blocks the flow

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:31.928
of blood to the brain.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.176
This is usually related to atherosclerosis,

00:00:35.256 --> 00:00:37.752
in which a fatty substance called plaque

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.696
builds up on the inner walls of the arteries.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.120
A blood clot can form in the arteries that

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.848
carry blood to the brain,

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.320
or it can form in another

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.320
part of the body and break off.

00:00:48.432 --> 00:00:51.152
The clot can then travel to blood vessels

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.232
supplying the brain and gets stuck,

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.288
blocking flow to the brain.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.936
Within a few seconds without oxygen,

00:00:57.936 --> 00:00:59.930
brain cells start to die

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.320
and brain damage begins.
