00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.320
Sulfa antibiotics also referred to as sulfonamides,

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.880
are used to treat many types of bacterial infections.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.380
Including urinary tract infections,

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.200
ear and eye infections,

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.700
pneumonia, bacterial meningitis,

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.840
and frequent or long-lasting bronchitis.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.420
Sulfa antibiotics do not kill bacteria,

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.500
but they prevent bacteria from being able to reproduce.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.220
Folate, a form of vitamin B9,

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.040
serves as a building block for the production of

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.860
RNA and DNA in the body.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.980
Unlike humans who get folate through their diet,

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.320
bacteria can not ingest folate.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.540
Sulfa antibiotics work

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.140
by binding and restricting a necessary enzyme

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.380
folate from being created.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.920
Without the production of RNA and DNA

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.980
bacteria can not divide or reproduce,

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.760
so they die or are killed by the immune system.
