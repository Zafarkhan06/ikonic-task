00:00:00.176 --> 00:00:01.800
Breast milk benefits a baby

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.152
in many ways,

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.616
providing the right balance of nutrients,

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:06.984
helping to protect against

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:08.696
illnesses and infections,

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.560
and possibly helping with brain development.

00:00:11.848 --> 00:00:13.496
Many of your baby’s physical

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:14.984
characteristics are designed

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.600
to help breastfeeding.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.216
The mechanics of sucking

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.768
require as much contact as possible

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.176
between the baby’s tongue and jawbone,

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:24.864
and the mother’s breast.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.840
To maximize contact,

00:00:26.904 --> 00:00:28.832
an infant’s tongue is large

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.096
in comparison to the size of the mouth

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:32.880
and the cheeks contain fat

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.200
to help keep the tongue

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.488
in the proper position for sucking.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.592
The same fat pads also ensure

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.392
that the cheeks don’t collapse while breastfeeding,

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.952
which would reduce the size of the mouth

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.688
and the negative pressure, required

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.792
to get milk from the breast into the mouth.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.992
A newborn’s upper airway

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.784
through which air enters and leaves the lungs

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.040
also supports breastfeeding.

00:00:57.136 --> 00:01:00.064
A newborn’s upper airway is very short.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.424
And the epiglottis

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.656
a flap of tissue at the base of the tongue

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.344
that keeps food from going down the windpipe

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.560
touches the soft tissue at the back

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.328
of the roof of the mouth.

00:01:10.608 --> 00:01:12.976
This combination of physical traits

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.480
helps direct milk to the esophagus,

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.176
which carries it to the stomach,

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.888
and reduces the risk of milk

00:01:18.888 --> 00:01:20.880
going down the windpipe.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.896
It also encourages the infant

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.472
to extend the neck,

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.600
which brings the lower jaw forward

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.504
to maximize contact with the breast.
