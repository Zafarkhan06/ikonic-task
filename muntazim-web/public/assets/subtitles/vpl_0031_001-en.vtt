00:00:00.816 --> 00:00:02.192
The hip joint is a

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:03.912
ball-and-socket joint.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.424
This type of joint

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:06.936
with a ball-shaped bone

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.032
fitting into a cup-like socket,

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.568
permits the leg to move

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.768
in a full circle,

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.024
or 360 degrees.

00:00:14.088 --> 00:00:15.720
Smooth cartilage covers

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.120
the surface of the bones,

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.344
to protect them,

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.464
reduce friction

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:20.936
and ease movement.

00:00:21.176 --> 00:00:23.680
Osteoarthritis of the hip occurs

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.736
when wear and tear on the joint

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.664
causes this smooth cartilage

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.960
to wear away.

00:00:29.192 --> 00:00:30.888
As the bones rub directly

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.080
against each other,

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.400
they can be damaged

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.864
and small growths called

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.624
bone spurs may develop.

00:00:36.872 --> 00:00:38.856
These changes can cause pain,

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.072
stiffness, and difficulty moving

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.720
and limit the legâ€™s range of motion.
