00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.620
anticholinergics can be used to describe

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.960
any medication reducing effects of acetylcholine,

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.100
a chemical messenger important for nerve and muscle functioning.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.920
Acetylcholine's effects are activated

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.800
when attached to specific receptors.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.880
There are two major types of these receptors,

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.480
nicotinic and muscarinic.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.740
Stimulation of nicotinic receptors affects the

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.980
brain's memory centers and skeletal muscles.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.000
Stimulation of the muscarinic receptors

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.360
tightens smooth muscle in the lungs,

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.460
bladder, eye, stomach and glands.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.420
Anticholinergic medications can attach to the specific receptors

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.860
to prevent acetylcholine stimulation generally

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.080
or in specific locations.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.260
While not fully understood,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.060
blocking nicotinic receptors may affect memory and body movement.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.120
Blocking specific muscarinic receptors

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.800
causes smooth muscle relaxation.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.600
This can lead to greater airflow in the lungs,

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.280
reduce nausea or motion sickness,

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.140
fewer urges to urinate,

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.620
dilation of the pupil in the eyes,

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.580
and reduced bodily secretions.
