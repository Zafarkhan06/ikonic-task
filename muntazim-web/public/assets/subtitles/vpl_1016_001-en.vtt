00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.560
If you have severe atherosclerosis symptoms

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.280
or narrowing in your arteries

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.320
your doctor may recommend angioplasty. 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.680
Angioplasty is a procedure used to open narrowed arteries

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.640
that supply blood to the body.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.700
The blocked artery may be anywhere in your body.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.140
In this procedure, your healthcare provider

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.140
inserts a long thin tube, called a catheter

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.480
into the narrowed or blocked artery.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.500
A small, deflated balloon

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.500
is passed through the catheter to the narrowed area.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.800
The balloon is inflated to stretch the narrowed artery.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.800
Then the balloon is deflated.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.480
A small mesh tube, called a stent,

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.960
may be left to help keep the artery open.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.820
The balloon and the catheter are removed.
