00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.470
Your stomach is located beneath

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:05.170
the sheet of muscle called your diaphragm.

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:08.330
Lying down often contributes to reflux

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.340
or backing up of stomach acid,

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:11.570
known as GERD,

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.220
through the same valve that opens to let

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.940
food or liquid enter from the esophagus.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.670
Sitting up can help reduce reflux of acid.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.460
The ability to move stomach contents up

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.980
through this valve can also be helpful,

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.920
such as getting rid of excess air in your stomach

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.600
or vomiting up something poisonous.
