00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.608
Spina bifida is a birth defect

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.432
caused by incomplete closure

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:06.912
of the spinal column before birth.

00:00:07.072 --> 00:00:09.376
This leaves an opening in the childâ€™s back

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.392
between the bones of the spine, or vertebrae.

00:00:12.736 --> 00:00:14.576
Spinal membranes or even the

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.224
spinal cord itself

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:18.248
can bulge through the opening.

00:00:18.472 --> 00:00:20.320
In mild spina bifida,

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.000
there may be only an opening in the

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
spine with no bulging of the spinal cord.

00:00:25.152 --> 00:00:26.688
 At its most severe,

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.384
the spinal cord sticks out

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.440
and is not covered by skin.

00:00:30.792 --> 00:00:32.944
Treatment of spina bifida depends

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.368
on its location and severity.

00:00:35.632 --> 00:00:37.704
When only the protective sac around

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.344
the spinal cord bulges out

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.176
and there is no nerve damage,

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.944
there is a good chance that the area

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.696
can be closed with surgery,

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.856
with no remaining effects.

00:00:47.208 --> 00:00:49.160
When the spinal cord sticks out,

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.680
the child's legs may be paralyzed.

00:00:51.888 --> 00:00:54.408
The severity of paralysis depends on

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.432
the location of the opening.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.904
Treatment involves closing the opening

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.392
with surgery and monitoring the child's

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:02.968
growth and development.

00:01:03.136 --> 00:01:04.832
It may also include:

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.424
Equipment such as waist

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.552
or leg braces, walkers, or crutches

00:01:09.696 --> 00:01:12.416
Diet and bowel training, and

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.888
Therapy or devices to help bladder control.
