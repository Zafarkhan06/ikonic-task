00:00:00.392 --> 00:00:03.496
Razor burn refers to a rash or bumps

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:05.728
caused by shaving dry skin,

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.000
not using enough cream or gel,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.504
or shaving too hard,

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.872
too fast or too close.

00:00:12.288 --> 00:00:14.648
Shaving does not simply remove hair.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.056
It also removes skin cells.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.448
Hair may also be cut off

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.688
slightly below the skin’s surface,

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:21.976
especially if you shave

00:00:21.976 --> 00:00:23.970
against the direction it’s growing

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.088
so that the razor catches and pulls

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.760
it away from the surface.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.152
Shaving too hard or too close

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.200
causes tiny cuts or openings

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.280
that allow bacteria to enter.

00:00:34.616 --> 00:00:37.320
When skin grows over the open hair shaft,

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.624
the hair cannot grow up and out

00:00:39.744 --> 00:00:42.648
and instead grows down into the follicle.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.608
Hair that is naturally curly

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.240
may kink around and grow into the skin

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.632
above or below the surface.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.048
All of these can cause inflammation

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.304
and a buildup of dead white cells and bacteria.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.608
The skin may be itchy or red

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.488
and small bumps may form.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.256
These can look like pimples,

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.104
especially if the follicle becomes infected.
