00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.540
A total knee replacement, or arthroplasty,

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.540
is a surgical procedure to remove

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.680
damaged portions of your knee joint

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.440
and replace them with plastic and metal implants.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.300
The knee joint is formed by the

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.220
femur (or thigh bone);

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.120
the tibia (or shin bone);

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.640
and the patella (or knee cap).

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.040
The end of each bone is covered with a layer

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.880
of smooth cartilage that cushions and protects

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.060
the bones during movement. 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.640
To begin the procedure,

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.240
your surgeon makes an incision

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.980
down the front of your knee.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.940
The first part of your knee that is exposed

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.800
is your patella, or kneecap.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.120
Your surgeon rotates the patella to the side.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.980
Damaged bone and cartilage

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.400
at the end of your femur 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.200
is carefully measured and cut away.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.820
Then your surgeon attaches

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.720
the metal femoral component

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.720
to the end of your femur. 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.000
Next, your surgeon removes damaged bone

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.380
and cartilage at the top of the tibia

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.620
and the bone is measured and shaped

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.280
to fit the tibial components.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.940
A metal tray is fit against the cut top

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.300
of the tibia and secured into place. 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.000
A plastic insert is snapped into the tibial tray.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.060
The femoral component slides on this tray

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.980
as you bend and flex your knee.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.440
Before returning your patella to its normal position,

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.120
your surgeon may remove part of the bone

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.800
and fit it with a plastic piece 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.720
to ensure a proper fit with the rest of your implant.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.060
Your surgeon will ensure correct balance,

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.980
alignment, position, and movement of your new knee.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.660
To finish the procedure,

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:48.620
your surgeon will close the incision with stitches or staples.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.640
Knee replacement can significantly

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.140
reduce pain and improve function.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.720
Like all surgeries, risks and complications are possible.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.380
Your doctor will explain these to you before surgery.
