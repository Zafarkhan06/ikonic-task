00:00:00.368 --> 00:00:03.976
Both whiteheads and blackheads are comedones,

00:00:04.168 --> 00:00:05.936
which means a hair follicle

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:07.520
with a plug made up of oil

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.064
and dead skin cells

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.288
that traps bacteria beneath.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.688
Microscopic glands in the skin

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.664
supply an oily substance called sebum

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.960
to hair follicles, often called pores.

00:00:20.256 --> 00:00:22.376
Sebum is designed to lubricate

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:23.616
the hair and skin

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.144
and usually drains to the surface.

00:00:26.408 --> 00:00:27.840
Sometimes, however,

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.640
the sebum becomes blocked

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.656
and bacteria begin to grow.

00:00:32.368 --> 00:00:34.808
If the build up of sebum and bacteria

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.512
does not have an opening to the surface

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.440
of the skin, it is called a whitehead.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.688
A blackhead forms if the pore

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.120
opens to the surface,

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.888
allowing air to enter.

00:00:45.528 --> 00:00:48.448
Sebum contains a pigment called melanin

00:00:48.672 --> 00:00:51.176
the same substance that gives our skin color.

00:00:51.408 --> 00:00:54.360
Melanin turns dark or oxidizes

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.328
if it is exposed to the air,

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.568
which is why blackheads are dark.

00:00:58.864 --> 00:01:00.280
They are not dirt

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.544
and scrubbing does not remove them.

00:01:02.656 --> 00:01:04.440
Both blackheads and whiteheads

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.688
can release their contents and heal,

00:01:06.864 --> 00:01:08.912
although this process can be slow.
