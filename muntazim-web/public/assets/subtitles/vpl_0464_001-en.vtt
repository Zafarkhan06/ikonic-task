00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.032
A womanâ€™s breasts are made up of

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:04.912
glands, fat, and fibrous tissue.

00:00:05.032 --> 00:00:07.624
For reasons that are not entirely clear,

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.416
the breast tissue in many women

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.320
develops a dense, irregular,

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.016
and bumpy consistency

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.520
known as fibrocystic disease.

00:00:15.704 --> 00:00:18.008
This noncancerous condition can affect

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.136
one breast more than the other.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.944
The changes may become more

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.888
or less obvious over the monthly

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.032
menstrual cycle as the amount of

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:27.896
fluid in the breast fluctuates with

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.768
changing hormone levels.

00:00:30.368 --> 00:00:32.288
A cancerous tumor can also

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.168
cause changes in the size or shape

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.128
of the breast,

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.936
or cause the skin to dimple

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.800
or look like an orange peel.

00:00:39.216 --> 00:00:41.520
Any changes in the appearance of the breast

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.056
should be checked by a health care practitioner.
