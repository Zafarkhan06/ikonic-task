00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.712
When a cancerous tumor grows new blood vessels form.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.600
The blood supplies the tumor with oxygen and nutrients.

00:00:08.704 --> 00:00:11.072
Cancer cells can also travel through these

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.024
blood vessels to other tissue,

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.152
where they can settle and grow.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.616
This process called metastasis,

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.816
can also occur in bone.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.048
Normal bone is continuously active.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.136
Old bone is broken down by

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.472
cells called Osteoclasts.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.328
while new bone is formed by

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.344
cells called Osteoblasts.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.992
As this happens,

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.464
the bone releases substances called growth factors

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.368
to support the process.

00:00:39.472 --> 00:00:42.128
When the cancer cells spread to the bone,

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.560
they take advantage of this cycle.

00:00:44.752 --> 00:00:48.888
The growth factors released help the cancer cells grow,

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.048
and the cancer cells in turn

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.840
release growth factors that stimulate Osteoclasts

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.456
and/or Ostreoblasts.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.768
Small holes can form

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.288
making bones weak and fragile,

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.696
and weak unstable growths can also build up.

00:01:05.896 --> 00:01:09.192
These changes can lead to serious complications,

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:10.488
like bone pain,

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.376
fractures,

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.120
and pressure on the spinal cord

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.648
that can damage nerves.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.312
Which can have significant impact on patient's lives.

00:01:18.552 --> 00:01:22.256
The spine, ribs, skull and upper arms and legs

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.984
are the most common areas

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.232
for cancer to spread to the bone.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.112
Treatment for bone metastasis can involve chemotherapy,

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.552
hormone therapy,

00:01:31.552 --> 00:01:33.550
radiation or surgery.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.544
Medications are also available that may help.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.032
See your doctor for treatment options.
