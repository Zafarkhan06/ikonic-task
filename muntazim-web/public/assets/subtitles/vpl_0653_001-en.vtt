Gingivitis means inflammation of the gums.

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.944
It most commonly develops in response

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.000
to the biofilm called plaque,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.960
which is made up of bacteria.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.312
Once the bacteria are anchored,

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.360
they bind to other bacteria

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.816
floating around the mouth

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.840
to form a kind of web.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.536
As the web grows,

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.016
it can hold onto more bacteria

00:00:22.016 --> 00:00:24.010
and the plaque thickens.

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.352
When the plaque is allowed to build up,

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.032
it attracts more types of bacteria.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.272
Over time, it hardens at the base of the teeth

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.880
into a material called tartar.
