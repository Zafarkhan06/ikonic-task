00:00:00.552 --> 00:00:02.128
A column of bones called

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.248
vertebrae make up your spine.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.232
Fusing or joining together

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:07.776
two or more vertebrae

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.920
is called spinal fusion.

00:00:10.144 --> 00:00:12.496
This surgical procedure may be performed

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.144
because of broken vertebra,

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:15.368
disk problems,

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.256
abnormal curves in the back,

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.552
or a spine weakened

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.888
by infections or tumors.

00:00:21.224 --> 00:00:22.576
A piece of bone,

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.424
often taken from the pelvis,

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.872
is added to the space

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:27.112
between the vertebrae

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.600
to join them together.

00:00:28.888 --> 00:00:31.432
Rods, plates, wires, or screws

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.648
may be attached to prevent the bones

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.584
from moving while the spinal fusion heals.
