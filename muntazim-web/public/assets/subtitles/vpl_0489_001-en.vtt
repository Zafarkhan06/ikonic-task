00:00:00.352 --> 00:00:02.984
Amniocentesis is a medical procedure

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:04.696
performed during pregnancy

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:06.632
to obtain a small amount of fluid

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.416
from the amniotic sac.

00:00:08.608 --> 00:00:10.768
The amniotic sac and fluid

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.056
surround and protect the fetus.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.192
Live skin cells from the fetus

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:16.872
are shed into the fluid.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.784
An amniocentesis test is performed with

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.896
ultrasound to guide the procedure

00:00:21.896 --> 00:00:23.890
and avoid harming the fetus.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.216
The fluid is obtained by inserting a

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.984
fine needle through the abdomen

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.208
into the uterus

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.712
and withdrawing a small amount of amniotic fluid.

00:00:33.032 --> 00:00:36.176
Examining DNA from skin cells in the fluid

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.544
can identify a genetic disorder

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.504
or chromosome abnormality

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.352
such as Downâ€™s syndrome.

00:00:42.648 --> 00:00:45.048
Amniocentesis is usually performed

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.232
between the 16th and 20th weeks of pregnancy.
