An angiogram is a type of x-ray that uses fluoroscopy,

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.210
essentially a “movie x-ray”,

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.470
to view arteries and veins.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.330
A special dye called contrast is used

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.620
to visualize the area of interest.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.270
Contrast is introduced into the vessel

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:20.330
through a catheter

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.930
and pictures are then made,

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.790
which help to detect bulges

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:24.830
(aneurysm),

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:25.690
narrowing

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:26.770
or blockage.
