00:00:00.272 --> 00:00:02.064
In a person with scoliosis,

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:04.088
the backbone or spine curves from

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.368
side to side instead of being straight.

00:00:06.768 --> 00:00:08.512
The area most commonly affected

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:09.808
is the bones or vertebrae

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.000
in the upper back. 

00:00:11.296 --> 00:00:13.448
Scoliosis develops gradually. 

00:00:13.608 --> 00:00:15.992
It is usually first noticed around puberty.

00:00:16.264 --> 00:00:18.104
Problems with the shape or formation

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.176
of the vertebrae,

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.656
legs of different lengths,

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.312
and disease are all potential causes.

00:00:23.656 --> 00:00:25.648
A person with scoliosis may have

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.000
uneven shoulders, hips, or waist;

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.288
a hump on one side of the back;

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.416
shoulder blades that stick out;

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.384
back pain; or lean to one side.

00:00:35.608 --> 00:00:37.712
Treatment depends on severity.

00:00:38.072 --> 00:00:39.616
Some people with scoliosis

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.328
are simply checked regularly.

00:00:41.544 --> 00:00:43.336
Others may wear braces and a

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.184
molded plastic shell that slows down

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.616
the curving process or undergo surgery.
