00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.860
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or NSAIDs,

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.700
reduce pain inflammation and swelling,

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.920
while helping the body return to a normal temperature.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.220
When the body is injured or ill,

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:18.460
it releases cyclooxygenase, an enzyme commonly known as COX.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.500
COX enzyme increases production of prostaglandins or PGs.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.640
While some PGs are necessary for cell health,

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.460
others can irritate nerves and cause pain and swelling.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.600
NSAIDs help control two specific types of COX enzymes,

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.880
COX-1 and COX-2.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.560
NSAIDs stop both types of COX enzymes from working.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.300
Thus reducing the level of PGs.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.540
Newer NSAIDs are designed to target COX-2 selectively

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.540
and leave COX-1 alone.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.860
Ideally this reduces pain and inflammation

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.920
without upsetting the stomach.
