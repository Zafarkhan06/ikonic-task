00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.016
In celiac disease,

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.424
a protein in wheat,

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.728
barley, and rye called gluten

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.024
triggers destruction of tiny hair-like

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:09.768
protrusions called villi

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.432
in the small intestine.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.088
Normally, villi allow vitamins,

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.568
minerals, and other nutrients

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.120
to be absorbed through the wall of the

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.496
small intestine into the bloodstream.

00:00:19.648 --> 00:00:21.504
In celiac disease,

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.688
gluten triggers the immune system

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.896
to damage or destroy the villi.

00:00:25.968 --> 00:00:27.890
Instead of being absorbed,

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.944
fats, proteins, minerals and vitamins

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.816
are eliminated in the stool.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.944
Decreased absorption of nutrients,

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.808
or mal-absorption,

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.456
can cause malnutrition

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.560
and other long-term problems.
