00:00:00.328 --> 00:00:02.680
Yeast is a type of fungus.

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:04.616
The type that usually causes

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:06.424
vaginal yeast infections is called

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.000
Candida albicans,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.376
or C. albicans for short.

00:00:10.704 --> 00:00:13.424
This fungus can live harmlessly on the skin,

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.016
and in the mouth, digestive tract, and vagina.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.272
Its growth in the vagina is usually

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:20.984
kept under control by certain

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.712
kinds of bacteria that also live there.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.656
But sometimes the balance

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.136
between these organisms is upset.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.312
For example,

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.608
antibiotics can kill the normal,

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.048
protective bacteria

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.624
and allow yeast to multiply.

00:00:35.816 --> 00:00:38.360
The yeast can form an irritating layer

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.960
in the lining of the vagina,

00:00:40.016 --> 00:00:41.824
leading to itching, burning,

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.408
and a white discharge that can

00:00:43.408 --> 00:00:45.400
look like cottage cheese.
