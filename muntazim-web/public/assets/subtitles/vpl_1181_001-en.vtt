00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.540
Vaping is harmful to your mental and physical health.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.660
Nicotine, the addictive ingredient found

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.080
in traditional cigarettes

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.880
is commonly found in vapes as well.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.580
When inhaling the aerosolized vape juice

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.380
the nicotine reaches your brain within 10 seconds

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.920
and triggers a big release of dopamine.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.020
Dopamine is one of the chemicals in your brain

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.020
that makes you feel calm and happy.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.320
Our brain naturally releases dopamine

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.200
to reward us when we do something that helps us survive.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.940
This surge of dopamine released from nicotine

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.280
rewires how the brain works.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.180
Once your brain is rewired,

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.140
it tells you to constantly chase that

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.080
original peak of dopamine.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.220
No matter how much nicotine is used

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.940
your brain will never reach that high again.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.560
Instead, your dopamine levels sink.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.360
Your brain sends signals telling you NEED the nicotine

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.720
a craving feeling and an addiction is developed.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.920
Vaping to reduce stress becomes the

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.720
very source of stress the minute

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.020
the addiction takes control of your life.

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:06.480
In addition to nicotine,

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.340
Vape juices usually contain

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.340
harmful preservatives and chemicals.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.820
Our lungs are designed to breathe air.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.320
Breathing aerosolized vape juice including

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.460
"just flavors" or others claiming

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.760
to have health benefits.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.160
Exposes the lungs to chemicals they're not

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.080
meant to breathe.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.660
Some vapes contain toxic chemicals

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.280
and known carcinogens like formaldehyde,

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.240
acrolein and arsenic.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.140
Others may contain harmful metals

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.340
such as nickel, lead and aluminum.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.120
Which may cause irreversible lung damage.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.560
Inside your lungs are

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.720
tiny balloon-shaped sacs called Alveoli.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.160
The alveoli are where oxygen enters your

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.000
body and is exchanged for carbon dioxide. 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.140
Surfactant is a fluid inside the alveoli

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.840
that helps keep the balloon-shape from collapsing.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.960
We now know that vaping damages

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.400
the alveoli and effects surfactant.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.440
Damaged alveoli leads to

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.340
reduced lung function and breathing issues.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.560
The most effective way to avoid addiction

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.160
is to never start vaping in the first place.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.020
If you do vape, quitting can be hard

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.720
but not impossible.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.800
Living smoke and vape free

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.720
is one of the best ways you can protect your health.
