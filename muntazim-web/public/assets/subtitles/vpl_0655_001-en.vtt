00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.424
We see through the process of light

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:05.224
being transmitted through the eye to the retina,

00:00:05.336 --> 00:00:08.152
which converts light into electrical impulses

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:09.656
that are sent to the brain.

00:00:09.752 --> 00:00:12.224
One part of the eye that changes with age

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.120
and affects vision is the lens.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.832
Along with the cornea,

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.000
the lens helps to bend light

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.688
to be focused on the retina.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:21.992
It changes shape

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.912
so that images of objects at different

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.168
distances are transmitted clearly.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.456
As we get older,

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.720
the lens becomes less flexible

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.408
and it becomes harder to focus

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.440
clearly on close objects.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.864
This is called presbyopia.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.920
This process may occur earlier

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.392
in people who are already farsighted.

00:00:40.576 --> 00:00:42.432
People who are nearsighted may be able

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.328
to see close objects clearly without their glasses,

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.008
but experience blurry vision

00:00:47.008 --> 00:00:49.000
when wearing lenses for distance.

00:00:49.288 --> 00:00:51.768
The easiest way to correct presbyopia

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.048
is with glasses.

00:00:53.352 --> 00:00:56.256
People who already wear glasses for distance vision

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.544
may need another pair

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.320
of glasses for close vision.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.720
Bifocals and progressive lenses

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.640
correct both distance and close up vision.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.640
People who wear contact lenses

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.816
for distance vision

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.048
may also need reading glasses

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.424
or they may use two monovision lenses,

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.664
that is, one contact lens for distance vision

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.776
and the other for close-up vision. 

00:01:18.968 --> 00:01:22.032
There are also surgical treatments for presbyopia.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.280
Options include reshaping the cornea with a laser

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.536
or low energy radio waves,

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.816
and implantation of a replacement lens.
