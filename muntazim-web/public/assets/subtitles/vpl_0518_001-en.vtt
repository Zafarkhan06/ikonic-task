00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.300
The carpal tunnel is a narrow,

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.700
passageway made of a ligament and bones

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.480
on the palm side of your wrist.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.140
It protects the tendons that bend your fingers

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:10.340
and the median nerve,

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.980
which run from your forearm into your hand.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.640
The median nerve provides

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:15.900
sensation to your thumb;

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.440
index and middle fingers;

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.980
and the inside half of your ring finger.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.800
It also provides signals that enable

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.820
the fingers and thumb to move.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.260
Carpal tunnel syndrome is a condition that

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.400
causes numbness, tingling and pain

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.920
in the hand and forearm.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.160
This condition happens

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.420
when the median nerve is

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:33.580
compressed or squeezed

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.960
as it passes through the carpal tunnel.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.060
The pressure can result from anything that

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.660
reduces space for the nerves in the carpal tunnel

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.620
For example, the lining of the tunnel

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.540
may swell if it becomes inflamed.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.860
Or the tendons may become swollen.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.440
And some people have a tunnel

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.340
that is narrower than normal.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.260
Treatment may include rest,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.320
ice, wrist splints,

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.580
cortisone injections

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.360
and surgery.
