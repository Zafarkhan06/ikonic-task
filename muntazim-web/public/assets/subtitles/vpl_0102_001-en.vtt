00:00:00.632 --> 00:00:01.992
As we age,

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:04.032
the constant replacement of cells

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:05.608
that occurs throughout life

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.160
slows down, and more

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.248
imperfect cells are produced.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.456
Changes in the skin

00:00:10.464 --> 00:00:12.232
reflect this process.

00:00:12.728 --> 00:00:13.760
The dermis,

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.352
the layer of skin right below the outer layer,

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.672
thins and loses

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.408
elastin and collagen,

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.144
proteins that keep the skin flexible.

00:00:22.472 --> 00:00:25.408
Muscles and fat cells become smaller.

00:00:25.544 --> 00:00:27.144
The skin sags and becomes

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.584
dry and wrinkled.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.320
Blood vessels, tendons,

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.248
and bones are more visible.

00:00:32.448 --> 00:00:34.048
Age spots appear.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.568
The risk of skin cancer increases,

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.128
and the ability to maintain a

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.704
constant temperature is diminished.
