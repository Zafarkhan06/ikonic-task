00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.760
Acting like a pump,

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:03.224
the human heart is a muscle

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:04.920
that contracts and relaxes

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.368
each time it beats.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.088
There are four  heart compartments

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.232
or chambers.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.288
The upper two are the atria,

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.544
and the lower two are ventricles.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.432
Blood comes into the chambers

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:16.320
and is then pumped

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.328
to the rest of the body

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.832
to supply nourishment.

00:00:19.176 --> 00:00:21.336
The flow of blood inside the heart

00:00:21.352 --> 00:00:23.056
is controlled by four thin,

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.976
flexible valves that open

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.904
and close with each heartbeat.

00:00:27.104 --> 00:00:28.984
They are the tricuspid valve,

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.456
the pulmonic valve,

00:00:30.512 --> 00:00:31.704
the mitral valve,

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.344
and the aortic valve.

00:00:33.688 --> 00:00:35.640
The aortic valve is composed of

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.016
3 tissue flaps, called leaflets.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.392
It is located between the

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.160
left ventricle and the aorta,

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.680
the blood vessel that carries blood

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.216
to the rest of the body.

00:00:44.552 --> 00:00:46.240
The aortic valve opens

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.736
to move blood from the heart

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:48.992
into the aorta.

00:00:49.296 --> 00:00:51.528
Aortic valve stenosis means

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.920
the valve opening in the heart is narrow

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.680
so the valve does not open all the way.

00:00:56.912 --> 00:00:57.904
As a result,

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.456
the heart must work harder

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.424
to pump blood to the body.
