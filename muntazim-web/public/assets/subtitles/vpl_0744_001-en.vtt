00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.680
Motion sickness can occur when you travel

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.736
by car, train, boat or airplane.

00:00:05.896 --> 00:00:08.440
When your brain receives conflicting signals

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.776
from your eyes, inner ears, muscles and joints

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.784
you begin to feel queasy and sweaty.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.920
For example, if you’re reading while sitting in a car

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.064
your eyes may not sense motion

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.208
but your inner ear can detect that you are moving.

00:00:23.488 --> 00:00:25.424
This disturbance originates from

00:00:25.424 --> 00:00:27.420
the labyrinth of the inner ear

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.128
the mechanism that controls balance.

00:00:30.344 --> 00:00:32.464
The inner ear—which contains, fluid

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.808
and hair-like sensors linked to nerves

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.208
send a message to the brain that does not

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.024
match what the eyes are seeing

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.264
or the body is experiencing.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.968
Symptoms of motion sickness include:

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.024
Dizziness

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.488
Cold sweat

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.672
Paleness

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:48.760
Nausea

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.008
and Vomiting

00:00:50.536 --> 00:00:52.576
There are a number of ways to reduce

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.224
or treat the effects of motion sickness:

00:00:55.376 --> 00:00:57.792
Maintain good air circulation.

00:00:58.048 --> 00:01:00.176
Don’t stay below deck in a boat

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.544
or look out the window in an airplane.

00:01:02.752 --> 00:01:05.680
Close your eyes if you begin to feel nauseous.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.232
Avoid reading or using a computer while in motion.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.208
Avoid alcohol.

00:01:11.384 --> 00:01:13.000
Consume ginger.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.248
Eat small amounts of low-fat,

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.976
starchy foods such as soda crackers.

00:01:18.304 --> 00:01:20.752
Consider using over the counter medication

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.944
or a skin patch if you will be on a boat

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.584
or plane for a long period of time.

00:01:26.048 --> 00:01:28.192
Motion sickness usually goes away

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:29.544
after you stop engaging

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.344
in the activity that caused it.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.144
If you experience severe motion sickness,

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.592
consult a doctor. 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.344
You may require surgery or

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.912
a prescription for a stronger medication.
