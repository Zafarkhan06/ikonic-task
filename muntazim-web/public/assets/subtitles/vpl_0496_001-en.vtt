00:00:00.208 --> 00:00:01.480
There are different ways to

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:03.408
manage pain during labor.

00:00:03.528 --> 00:00:05.776
One method is a local anesthetic

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:07.952
called epidural anesthesia.

00:00:08.152 --> 00:00:10.992
This method is often patient controlled.

00:00:11.152 --> 00:00:12.608
When relief is needed,

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.360
the woman presses a button.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.160
This delivers anesthesia

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.840
into the epidural space,

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.336
which is between the bony spinal canal

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.352
and tough outer covering of the spinal cord.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.032
Sometimes the woman can also move around

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.600
a so-called “walking epidural.”

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.560
Another option called a spinal epidural

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.984
delivers a spinal block and epidural

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.672
in a single injection;

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.328
this option can be used

00:00:37.328 --> 00:00:38.968
far along in labor.
