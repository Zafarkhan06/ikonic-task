00:00:00.744 --> 00:00:03.424
When a blood vessel is cut or damaged,

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.792
blood loss needs to be stopped.

00:00:06.072 --> 00:00:08.088
This happens through coagulation

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.824
or clotting of blood to form a plug.

00:00:11.048 --> 00:00:13.272
Clotting begins when cell fragments

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.752
called platelets circulating in your blood

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.256
begin to clump or stick together.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.424
This is called platelet aggregation.

00:00:21.608 --> 00:00:23.664
The clumps of platelets are held together

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.048
by a network of protein molecules

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.120
called fibrin activated by

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.000
clotting factors in your blood.

00:00:30.176 --> 00:00:31.752
A blood clot is made up of

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.096
fibrin and clumps of platelets.

00:00:35.208 --> 00:00:38.944
Antiplatelet drugs prevent clumping of platelets.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.160
Millions of people take them to prevent

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.512
inappropriate or dangerous clotting

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.216
that can block blood flow and

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.368
cause a stroke or heart attack.

00:00:47.496 --> 00:00:50.672
They are used to treat a variety of conditions.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.304
For example, they can prevent blood clots

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.488
in an artery clogged with plaque.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.872
Antiplatelet drugs are also a

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.760
very important part of care

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.464
after placement of a stent

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.952
to restore free blood flow through a clogged artery.

00:01:05.136 --> 00:01:06.864
Sometimes stents can become

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.592
blocked with scar tissue.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.272
This is called restenosis.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.112
Some stents are coated with medicine

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.712
to help prevent this.

00:01:15.464 --> 00:01:17.592
Blood flow is also occasionally

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.824
blocked when platelets attracted to the stent 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.184
site and healing process form blood clots.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.288
This is called thrombosis;

00:01:25.328 --> 00:01:27.904
it can cause a potentially fatal heart attack

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.384
or necessitate a repeat procedure.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.176
Antiplatelet drugs help

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.432
to keep these clots from forming. 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.488
Different antiplatelet drugs

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.240
work in different ways.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.032
They need to be taken for as long

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.624
as your doctor directs.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.464
Don’t stop them without permission

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.544
of the doctor who prescribed them.
