00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.880
Beta blockers prevent natural chemicals, neurotransmitters,

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.140
from overstimulating and damaging the body.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:13.880
These neurotransmitters can attach to beta receptors all over the body,

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.080
including the heart, kidneys and eyes.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.200
Neurotransmitters that attach to beta receptors can cause a faster heartbeat,

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.780
narrower blood vessels, and more fluid pressure in the eyes.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.160
Beta blockers compete with neurotransmitters

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.480
to attach to the beta receptors and prevent their stimulation.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.920
Beta blockers can target just one or a few different

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.380
locations to block the receptors.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.420
In the heart, blocking the receptors slows the heart rate.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.060
In the kidneys, blocking the receptors effects the hormone, renin,

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.840
and keeps the blood vessel walls open.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.640
In the eye, blocking the receptors decreases fluid pressure.
