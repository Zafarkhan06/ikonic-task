00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.840
Acetaminophen is used to treat mild to moderate pain.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.540
Including headaches, muscle aches, backache,

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.240
toothaches, arthritis, menstrual pain,

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.940
colds and fevers.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.400
It is part of a class of medications known as

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.000
analgesics or pain relievers

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.020
and antipyretics or fever reducers.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.040
Although exactly how it works isn't known,

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.200
Acetaminophen targets the central nervous system.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.160
and inhibits activation of an enzyme known as

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.000
Cyclooxygenase or COX.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.460
Within the body COX changes fatty acids,

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.900
in this case arachidonic acid,

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.320
into a substance known as Protaglandin.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.540
Prostaglandin possesses protective qualities

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.100
that benefit the body

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.480
and is neccessary for cell function.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.480
However, the substance can also generate

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.960
pain, inflammation and fever.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.360
By blocking COX and the resulting production of Prostaglandin,

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.240
Acetaminophen reduces both symptoms and fever.
