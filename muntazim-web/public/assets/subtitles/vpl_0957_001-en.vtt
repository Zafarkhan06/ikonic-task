00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.540
Nitroimidazoles are antibiotics that are used to treat

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.720
a number of infections caused by bacteria

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.420
that don't need oxygen to stay alive

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.860
and other single celled organisms called protozoa.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.980
These include infections caused by certain parasites.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.280
Infections may or can occur in the mouth,

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.280
stomach, skin, joints and respiratory tract,

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.460
as well as some types of sexually transmitted diseases.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.160
Nitroimidazole antibiotics treat infections

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.280
by selectively entering the cells of bacteria

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.340
or parasites through small holes.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.780
The cell strips the drug molecule of oxygen,

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.400
making it more toxic to the cell.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.520
When the drug attaches to the cell's DNA,

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.880
the structure becomes unstable and the DNA will break.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.360
Once the cells can no longer multiply adequately

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.260
the infection is weakened

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.280
and the body's natural immune system takes over

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.180
allowing recovery to take place.
