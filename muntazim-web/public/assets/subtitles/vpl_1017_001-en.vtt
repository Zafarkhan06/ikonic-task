00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:04.280
The shoulder is a ball and socket joint.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.200
The ball is at the top of the arm bone, or humerus.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.460
The socket is within the shoulder blade, or scapula.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.200
Total shoulder replacement surgery can be effective

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.380
at relieving severe pain from arthritis of the shoulder.

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.700
TSR replaces the damaged parts of the shoulder joint

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.860
with plastic and metal components. 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.380
To begin, your surgeon will make an incision

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.180
on the front of your shoulder.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.180
Your surgeon will remove the damaged bone and cartilage

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:30.880
at the end of the humerus.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.320
Your surgeon then smooths and reshapes

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.420
the socket portion of the shoulder blade.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.580
A plastic socket component is placed

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.920
with bone cement in the prepared socket.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.600
A metal stem is implanted in the center of your humerus.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.040
A metal ball is attached to the stem.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.100
The new ball portion of the humerus is 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.440
inserted into the socket part of the shoulder. 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.900
To finish the procedure,

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.580
your surgeon will close the incision with stitches 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.200
and cover it with a soft dressing.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.760
Following surgery, you will wear an arm sling

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.880
and be prescribed physical therapy.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.560
Your surgeon will explain what you can expect.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.740
Like all surgeries, risks and complications are possible.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.240
Your surgeon will explain these to you.
