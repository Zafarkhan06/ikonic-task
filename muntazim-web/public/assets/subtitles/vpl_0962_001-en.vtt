00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:05.900
HIV or human immunodeficiency virus is the cause of AIDS.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.240
It can infect the bloodstream following unprotected sex

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.820
with an infected person,

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.820
Exposure to infected blood,

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.580
or can be passed from an infected pregnant mother to her child.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.400
Having unprotected sex or sharing drug injection equipment

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.740
with a person infected with HIV

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.280
are the two most common ways to become infected.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.440
Once infected, the HIV virus attacks and destroys

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.600
the infection fighting CD4 cells of the body's immune system.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.720
The loss of the immune system leaves patients vulnerable to illnesses.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.240
Including cancer, opportunistic infections and dementia.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.920
There is no cure for HIV Aids,

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.100
but there are treatments that slow the progression of AIDS,

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.780
by limiting the number of immune cells that are destroyed.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.020
The body can then replace the ones that are lost.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.300
There are combinations of drugs used to treat HIV

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.140
called cocktails, or triple therapy.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.700
These cocktails attack HIV in different ways

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.600
and protect the immune system

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.800
so it can continue to fight infections.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.480
One part of the cocktail or triple therapy

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:19.240
is called nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors or NRTIs.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.500
After HIV enters the CD4 cells,

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.360
it migrates to the cells genetic material to reproduce itself.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.500
NRTI medications block the virus from replicating.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.960
NRTIs are considered the backbone of HIV therapy

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.460
because they stop the most important step

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.940
within the life cycle of an HIV virus.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.720
One part of the cocktail is called

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:51.280
 Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors or NNRTIs.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.120
After HIV enters the immune cell

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.640
it starts to make copies of itself.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.120
But before it can make those copies

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:04.520
NNRTI medications block the HIV virus from replicating.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.040
NNRTI medications are part of the HIV cocktail

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.480
that work before HIV can make more copies of itself.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.920
One part of the cocktail or triple therapy

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.380
is called a protease inhibitor.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.060
A chemical called protease is used to clip the HIV protein

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.060
into strands that contain a new virus,

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.080
which are then released into the body to do more damage.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.560
Protease inhibitors stop this step,

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.520
and prevent the manufacture and release of new viruses.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.160
Protease inhibitors are the part of the HIV cocktail

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.240
that prevents HIV from sending out new HIV cells.
