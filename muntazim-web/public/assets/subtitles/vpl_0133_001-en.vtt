00:00:00.456 --> 00:00:02.392
If your child has a hernia,

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:04.560
it means the intestine or bowel

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.832
is bulging through a weak

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:07.608
area in the abdomen.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.656
Sometimes the muscles in the

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.256
abdomen do not come together

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.088
completely before birth.

00:00:13.248 --> 00:00:14.968
This leaves a small opening

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.272
below the skin.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.270
An umbilical hernia

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.760
is an opening in the belly button area

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.968
and an inguinal hernia is an opening

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.480
in the groin area.

00:00:24.888 --> 00:00:26.952
A hernia is usually diagnosed

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:28.272
because of a bulge

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.400
sometimes with pain or discomfort

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.888
in the belly button or groin area.

00:00:33.304 --> 00:00:35.240
If your child has a hernia,

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.560
it needs to eventually close.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.744
If it does not,

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.680
the intestines or other contents

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.808
of the abdomen may

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.488
push through the opening.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.072
Movement of food can be affected. 

00:00:46.312 --> 00:00:48.408
The intestines may become blocked,

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.952
causing pain, redness, swelling, and vomiting.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.224
Pinching may restrict blood flow,

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.712
which can lead to other complications.
