00:00:00.304 --> 00:00:02.256
Vitiligo is a medical condition

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:03.568
in which areas of the skin

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.080
become depigmented,

00:00:05.296 --> 00:00:06.688
which means they lighten

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.368
or turn completely white.

00:00:08.624 --> 00:00:11.952
Hair can also become prematurely white or gray.

00:00:12.096 --> 00:00:14.656
The color of our eyes, skin, and hair

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.368
is determined by a pigment called melanin,

00:00:17.512 --> 00:00:18.960
which is produced by cells

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.752
called melanocytes.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.376
In vitiligo, melanocytes die

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:25.992
or are destroyed by cells

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.744
from the bodyâ€™s immune system.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.896
As the melanocytes die,

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.784
patches of skin turn white

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.152
because the melanocytes

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.176
are no longer making melanin.

00:00:35.464 --> 00:00:38.384
Vitiligo affects people of all races,

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.048
but can be especially noticeable

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.888
in those with darker skin.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.192
It can develop anywhere on the body,

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.104
but often starts on the face,

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.560
hands, arms, and feet.

00:00:48.832 --> 00:00:51.216
There may be only a few light spots,

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.760
or widespread loss of skin color.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.264
There is no way to predict

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.848
how much it will spread.

00:00:57.024 --> 00:00:59.768
Sometimes vitiligo stops on its own.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.056
In other cases,

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.976
loss of pigment continues until

00:01:02.976 --> 00:01:05.096
it affects most of the skin surface.
