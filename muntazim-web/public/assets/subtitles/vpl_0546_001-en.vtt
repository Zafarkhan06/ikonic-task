00:00:00.424 --> 00:00:02.832
Before a vaccine was available,

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.608
about 4 million children in the U.S.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.072
developed chickenpox each year.

00:00:08.248 --> 00:00:10.432
The best known signs of chickenpox

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:13.048
are an itchy rash and small blisters,

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.976
which can spread across the entire body.

00:00:16.304 --> 00:00:18.080
Chickenpox is caused by the

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.264
varicella zoster virus.

00:00:20.264 --> 00:00:22.260
After a chickenpox infection,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.440
the virus can remain in the body,

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.432
traveling down nerves that carry

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.344
sensations to the brain.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.256
It can hide in nerve tissues near

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.488
the spinal column and brain for decades.

00:00:33.768 --> 00:00:37.400
Many years later, the virus may come out of hiding

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.160
and be reactivated in a form known as shingles.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.808
It can cause pain and tingling along nerve pathways,

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.392
usually on one side of the body.

00:00:47.568 --> 00:00:50.576
The pain is often accompanied by a red rash,

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.432
which is usually limited to a

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.584
small section on one side.

00:00:54.736 --> 00:00:57.376
Some people complain of persistent pain,

00:00:57.408 --> 00:00:59.960
even after the rash has disappeared.
