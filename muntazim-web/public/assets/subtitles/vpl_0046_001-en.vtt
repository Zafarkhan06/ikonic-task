00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.248
Total knee arthroplasty, or replacement,

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.992
is a surgical procedure

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:06.200
in which a diseased

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.800
or damaged knee joint

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.400
is replaced with an artificial joint.

00:00:10.752 --> 00:00:12.056
Your knee is made up of

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:13.896
the lower end of your thighbone,

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:14.944
or femur;

00:00:15.128 --> 00:00:16.848
the upper end of the shinbone,

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:17.976
or tibia;

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.384
and the kneecap or patella.

00:00:20.592 --> 00:00:22.768
Most replacement joints consist of

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.952
a metal femoral component;

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:26.864
a plastic tibial component

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.592
held in a metal tray;

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.240
and a plastic patellar component.

00:00:31.608 --> 00:00:33.160
The procedure begins with

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.160
an incision on the front of the knee

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.792
and the kneecap is moved to the side.

00:00:38.056 --> 00:00:39.928
Damaged bone and cartilage at

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.160
the end of the femur are cut away

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:44.000
and the bone is measured and cut

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.360
to fit into the femoral component,

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.272
which is then attached.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.160
Next, damaged bone and cartilage

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.848
at the top of the tibia

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.216
re cut away and the bone is measured

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.168
and cut to fit into the tibial component.

00:00:58.352 --> 00:01:00.232
A metal tray is fit against the

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.336
flat-cut top of the bone

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.304
with its stem inserted into the bone.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.480
A plastic insert is snapped

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.256
into the tibial tray.

00:01:09.488 --> 00:01:11.408
The femoral component slides

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.336
on it when the knee is bent.

00:01:13.632 --> 00:01:15.664
The damaged portion of the kneecap

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:16.928
may be replaced by

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.280
a mushroom shaped prosthesis.

00:01:19.528 --> 00:01:22.144
The resectioned patella and prosthesis

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.456
are attached to other components.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.816
Measurements and tests to ensure

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.208
balance and movement

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.784
are done during and after surgery.

00:01:30.992 --> 00:01:33.296
Knee replacement can significantly

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.976
reduce pain and improve function.

00:01:36.264 --> 00:01:39.472
Like all surgery, there are associated risks.

00:01:39.552 --> 00:01:42.576
Physical therapy and realistic expectations

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.200
are important for successful recovery.
