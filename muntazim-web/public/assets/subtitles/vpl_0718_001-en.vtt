00:00:00.368 --> 00:00:02.336
For many women, menopause

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:04.600
is a turning point in bone strength.

00:00:05.032 --> 00:00:08.712
Over time, it can lead to development of osteoporosis

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.160
and increased risk for fractures.

00:00:11.392 --> 00:00:13.320
Osteoporosis results from an

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.600
imbalance in bone remodeling.

00:00:15.824 --> 00:00:18.928
Removalâ€”also called resorption

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.592
outpaces formation of new bone.

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.120
Before menopause,

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.672
there is a relative balance between the removal of

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.736
old bone by cells called osteoclasts

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.584
and the formation of new bone

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.424
by cells called osteoblasts.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.776
This is a complex and constant process. 

00:00:37.064 --> 00:00:39.200
When estrogen levels decline,

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.152
osteoclasts become overactive.

00:00:42.464 --> 00:00:45.896
They remove bone faster than it can be replaced. 

00:00:46.304 --> 00:00:48.928
Over time, this can lead to thinning

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.392
and weakening of bone

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.536
that may put you at risk for fracture.

00:00:54.024 --> 00:00:56.424
The diagnosis of osteoporosis

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.504
can in part be based on a bone density scan

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.448
and the result is shown as a T-score.

00:01:03.112 --> 00:01:05.544
A T-score of less than or equal to

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.832
negative 2.5 defines osteoporosis

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.632
and the lower the score,

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.168
the higher the risk of fracture can be.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.904
Many other factors also contribute to risk of fracture.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.552
Some of these include:

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.080
A prior osteoporotic fracture;

00:01:22.256 --> 00:01:24.432
Family history of hip fracture;

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.936
Cigarette smoking; and

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.152
Excess consumption of alcohol. 

00:01:29.664 --> 00:01:31.696
It is important for women to be aware

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.392
of the risks associated with osteoporosis

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:35.696
after menopause.

00:01:35.848 --> 00:01:38.792
Your doctor can help to estimate your risk of fracture

00:01:38.912 --> 00:01:41.688
and steps you can take to reduce this risk.
