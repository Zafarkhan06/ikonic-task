00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.040
Each of the trillions of cells

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.792
that make up the human body

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.152
contain 23 pairs of structures

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.816
 called chromosomes.

00:00:07.928 --> 00:00:10.224
A chromosome is made up of a coil,

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.624
or double helix of DNA.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.760
The DNA provides a complete

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.904
set of instructions for how our

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.304
bodies should develop and function.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.248
There are also short sets or instructions

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.672
within the DNA called genes.

00:00:24.872 --> 00:00:26.936
The mother and father each provide

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.024
half of the complete set of genes

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.704
a baby is born with.

00:00:30.872 --> 00:00:33.104
The genes provide instructions for over

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.856
200 different types of cells.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.032
A cell needs to know which

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.136
short set of instructions to follow

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.130
and which of the parents’ genes will be

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.984
active or expressed.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.608
Sometimes the mother’s,

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.136
sometimes the father’s,

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.488
sometimes both,

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.576
and sometimes neither parental gene is active.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.032
Chemical and molecular processes

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.344
determine which genes are expressed

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.088
by tagging them for certain functions.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.936
Tagging loosens the coil of DNA,

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.248
which is normally wound tightly around

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.520
spools of proteins called histones,

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.304
and would be 40,000 times

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.224
longer, if unwound.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.448
Loosening or slightly unwinding the coil

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.528
makes the genes accessible

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.632
so they can make proteins required for the structure,

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.984
function, and regulation of tissues and organs.

00:01:22.096 --> 00:01:25.368
Through tagging, genes can be turned on and off,

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.208
which permits fast adaptation

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.288
to changes in the environment.

00:01:29.424 --> 00:01:32.312
During pregnancy, the mother’s actions

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.424
and the environment can influence

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:35.952
where the tags go

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.304
and which genes will be expressed

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.664
which can affect the health

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.280
of the developing baby.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.000
Some changes continue throughout life

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.456
and can be passed down from

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.384
one generation to the next.
