00:00:00.136 --> 00:00:01.848
Renal failure means your

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:03.696
kidneys have stopped functioning.

00:00:03.808 --> 00:00:05.784
Sometimes this happens abruptly,

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:07.632
and is potentially reversible.

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:08.904
In other cases,

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.056
known as end-stage renal disease,

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.656
the kidneys permanently stop functioning,

00:00:14.984 --> 00:00:16.592
and only dialysis

00:00:16.592 --> 00:00:18.590
or kidney transplantation

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.608
will allow you to continue living.

00:00:21.048 --> 00:00:22.984
Dialysis involves filtering a

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.968
personâ€™s blood through a machine

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.184
because the kidneys cannot perform this vital function.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.504
In kidney transplantation,

00:00:30.688 --> 00:00:32.712
a working kidney from a donor

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.552
takes over the function of the failed kidneys.

00:00:35.744 --> 00:00:38.192
This is done through a surgical procedure.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.560
The new kidney is placed in the abdomen

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.192
through a surgical incision.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.960
It is attached to the artery and vein

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.640
that supplied blood and carried blood away

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.928
from one of the failed kidneys.

00:00:50.184 --> 00:00:52.376
The new kidney is also attached

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:53.904
via the ureter,

00:00:54.032 --> 00:00:55.680
a tube that carries urine

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.368
from the kidney to the bladder.

00:00:57.768 --> 00:01:00.480
Unless the old kidneys are causing problems,

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.696
they are usually left in place.

00:01:03.032 --> 00:01:04.856
Although life-long medication

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.880
and monitoring are required,

00:01:07.072 --> 00:01:10.000
the new kidney will enable the person who received it

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.336
to live a relatively normal life.
