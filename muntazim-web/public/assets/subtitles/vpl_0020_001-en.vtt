00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.830
Heart attacks occur when blood flow

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:07.510
to the heart muscle is blocked.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.390
The most common cause is

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.030
fatty deposits called plaque

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:12.640
in the coronary arteries,

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:15.260
which supply blood and oxygen to the heart.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.380
Plaque build-up begins as early as childhood,

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.880
when fat is deposited in the arteries.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.700
As you get older,

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.700
other substances such as protein,

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:25.660
cholesterol,

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.240
white blood cells and calcium

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.520
are also deposited

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.330
contributing to the build-up.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:32.930
This build up of plaque is called

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.970
Coronary Artery Disease.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.330
If the heart muscle does not get enough

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.470
blood and oxygen to meet its needs,

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.610
a person may experience angina,

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.230
a type of chest pain.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.820
If the plaque build-up breaks open,

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.620
the body tries to fix it

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:48.970
by forming a clot.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.890
This clot can block the coronary artery

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.000
and prevent the flow of blood and oxygen

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.130
to the point that the heart muscle dies,

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:57.720
causing a heart attack.
