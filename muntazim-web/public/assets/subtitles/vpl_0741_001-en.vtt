00:00:00.424 --> 00:00:03.024
Rosacea is a chronic skin condition

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:05.584
that usually starts in middle age.

00:00:05.728 --> 00:00:08.752
Patches of skin on the cheeks, nose, chin,

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.056
and forehead become red and inflamed

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.472
around hair follicles and tiny glands

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.552
in the skin that produce oil.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.992
The exact cause is not known

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:19.888
but the symptoms are thought to be due

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.288
to a disorder of the blood vessels just under the skin.

00:00:23.472 --> 00:00:25.728
Rosacea usually starts as a mild

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.608
flush that comes and goes.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.488
It can affect specific areas 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.320
or cover the whole face. 

00:00:31.552 --> 00:00:33.320
As rosacea progresses,

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.808
the redness can become more intense.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.632
There may be spots, bumps

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.136
or skin eruptions that look like acne.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.856
Tiny red blood vessels may be visible.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.392
There may be swelling,

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.176
and the nose may become red and bulbous,

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.784
a condition known as rhinophyma.
