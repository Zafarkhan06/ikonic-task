00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.840
Atypical antipsychotics are used to treat various mental health symptoms,

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.240
including hallucinations, delusions, aggression,

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.720
or abnormal behavior and thinking.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.440
In some cases they can also be used to treat

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.520
non-psychotic disorders.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.060
The exact way atypical antipsychotics work isn't known.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.700
It is believed that these medications appear

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.500
to block certain chemical receptors in the brain

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.840
that are activated by chemical messangers

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.420
like serotonin and dopamine.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.140
The atypical antipsychotics

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.500
are more likely to block certain types of

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.080
serotonin receptors than dopamine receptors.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.280
This is thought to be the reason they produce

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.660
fewer side effects that affect movement,

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.160
and can treat more conditions than the older

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.600
typical antipsychotics of the past.
