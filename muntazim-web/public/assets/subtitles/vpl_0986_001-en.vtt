00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440
HIV or human immunodeficiency viruses is the cause of AIDS.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.640
It can infect the bloodstream following

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.240
unprotected sex from an infected person,

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.240
exposure to infected blood,

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.040
or can be passed from an infected pregnant mother to her child.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.880
Having unprotected sex or sharing drug injection equipment

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.200
with a person infected with HIV

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.760
are the two most common ways to become infected.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.900
Once infected, the HIV virus attacks and destroys

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.080
the infection fighting CD4 cells of the body's immune system.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.540
The loss of the immune system leaves patients

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.180
vulnerable to illnesses,

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.660
including cancer, opportunistic infections and dementia. 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.340
There is no cure for HIV AIDS,

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.580
but there are treatments that slow the progression of AIDS

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.260
by limiting the number of immune cells that are destroyed.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.460
The body can then replace the ones that are lost.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.780
There are combination of drugs used to treat HIV

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.700
called cocktails or triple therapy.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.180
These cocktails attack HIV in different ways

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.180
and protect the immune system

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.240
so it can continue to fight infections.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.960
One part of the cocktail or triple therapy

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.620
is called nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors or NRTIs.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.160
After HIV enters the CD4 cells,

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.680
it migrates to the cell's genetic material to reproduce itself.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.040
NRTI medications block the virus from replicating.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.420
NRTIs are considered the "backbone" of HIV therapy.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.980
Because they stop the most important step

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.620
within the life cycle of an HIV virus.
