00:00:00.296 --> 00:00:02.200
The health of your teeth depends

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.656
in large part on the health

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:04.840
of your gums.

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.848
In fact, the leading cause of

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.000
tooth loss is gingivitis,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.688
which means inflammation of the gums.

00:00:11.936 --> 00:00:13.832
It begins when plaque

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.344
a sticky substance made up of bacteria,

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.480
saliva, and food particles

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.160
wedges between your gums and teeth.

00:00:21.256 --> 00:00:23.640
This triggers a process of inflammation

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.544
in the gums around the teeth

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.800
that causes the gums to slowly erode.

00:00:29.016 --> 00:00:32.048
Over time, the inflammation can cause

00:00:32.048 --> 00:00:34.040
deep pockets to form between the

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.336
teeth and gums

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.048
and loss of the bone that

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.680
holds the teeth in place.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.200
This is known as periodontitis.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.696
Eventually, the teeth

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.000
may become loose and fall out.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.680
Gum disease can also

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.384
contribute to cavities.

00:00:48.544 --> 00:00:50.432
Bacteria can enter a crevice

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.176
between the gum and tooth

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.592
and eat its way into the tooth.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.648
If the cavity goes deep enough,

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.072
it can affect the pulp

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.776
at the center of the tooth.

00:00:59.936 --> 00:01:01.608
The pulp has nerves that can

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.048
carry the pain all the way

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.456
into jaw bone,

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:06.792
causing excruciating pain.
