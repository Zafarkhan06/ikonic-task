00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.830
In total hip replacement surgery,

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:04.060
the head of the femur,

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:05.800
or thighbone is removed,

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.450
and the femur is prepared for

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.650
placement of the femoral stem.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.840
A metal ball attached to the end of the stem

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.100
fits into an artificial socket,

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.980
which has already been placed in the acetabulum,

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.620
the cup-shaped hollow in the hipbone

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.230
Together these components replace

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.620
the normal ball and socket joint.
