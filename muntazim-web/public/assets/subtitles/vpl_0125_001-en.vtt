00:00:00.296 --> 00:00:02.784
Influenza, also known as the flu,

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:04.368
is a respiratory infection

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.024
caused by a virus.

00:00:06.208 --> 00:00:07.848
The virus spreads through close

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.272
contact with someone who is

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:10.632
sneezing or coughing,

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:12.232
or by handling objects that were

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:14.312
touched by someone with the flu.

00:00:14.512 --> 00:00:16.176
Compared to a cold,

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.336
flu symptoms develop much faster

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.776
and are more severe.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.504
They can last from 3 days

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.744
to 2 weeks.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.568
Symptoms of the flu include:

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:25.872
chills and fever

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:27.160
muscle aches

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.032
headache

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:29.104
runny nose

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:29.832
cough

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.184
sore throat

00:00:31.552 --> 00:00:33.208
You can reduce the chances

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.952
of your child getting the flu

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.488
by keeping them away from people who are sick,

00:00:37.496 --> 00:00:38.968
keeping your hands and your

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.400
child’s hands clean,

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.848
and having any child

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.424
over 6 months old

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.024
vaccinated for the flu

00:00:45.032 --> 00:00:46.152
each year.
