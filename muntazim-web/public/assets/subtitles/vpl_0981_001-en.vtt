00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.960
Infections occur when large amounts of bacteria

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.940
sneak past the body's natural defenses and multiply.

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.460
Quinolones are antibiotics that treat a variety of bacterial infections.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.040
When an infection occurs within a body

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.180
bacteria multiply quickly

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.420
and release chemicals that build up and lead to illness

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.820
and in severe cases, death.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.000
All of the genetic material that drives the bacteria to multiply

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.840
is contained in the bacteria's nucleus.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.840
Quinolones easily enter bacteria cells through small holes

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.600
allowing them to access the nucleus.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.980
Two specific enzyme are needed by bacteria to copy its DNA

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.320
and create more bacteria.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.260
Quinolones block both types of enzymes

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.380
so the bacteria's DNA cannot be copied.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.740
If bacteria cannot be copied,

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.020
they cannot multiply and cause an infection.
