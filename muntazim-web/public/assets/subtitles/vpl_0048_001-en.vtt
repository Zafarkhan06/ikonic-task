00:00:00.368 --> 00:00:01.792
Extending from your neck

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:02.992
to your hipbones,

00:00:03.176 --> 00:00:05.096
a column of 33 bones

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:06.496
known as vertebrae

00:00:06.616 --> 00:00:08.736
is the core of your backâ€™s structure.

00:00:09.048 --> 00:00:10.544
These bones support the weight

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:11.768
of your upper body

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.152
and also house the spinal cord,

00:00:14.336 --> 00:00:16.088
which carries signals that control

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.008
your movements and convey sensations.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.640
Holes in the center of each vertebra

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.160
form a channel when they are stacked.

00:00:24.624 --> 00:00:26.736
The spinal cord runs through and is

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.936
protected by this bony channel.

00:00:29.112 --> 00:00:31.264
Nerves extending from the spinal cord

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.624
emerge through spaces

00:00:32.632 --> 00:00:33.960
between the vertebrae.
