00:00:02.512 --> 00:00:04.976
Headaches are common at any age.

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:06.656
There are three basic types:

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.904
tension, cluster, and migraine headaches.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.424
Tension headaches brought on by stress

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.032
and emotional strain are the most common.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.720
Pain is usually felt on

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.040
both sides of the head,

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.160
at the temples or

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.656
back of the head and neck.

00:00:20.888 --> 00:00:23.088
Less common are cluster headaches,

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.608
which are marked by severe,

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.560
one-sided pain that comes back

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.224
in episodes or clusters

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.016
over weeks or months.

00:00:30.184 --> 00:00:31.808
They start in an area of the brain

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.176
called the hypothalamus,

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.208
which is more active

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.408
during the headache.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.208
These debilitating headaches

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.624
run in families.

00:00:39.392 --> 00:00:40.480
Migraine headaches

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.064
also run in families.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.560
They are often confused with

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.264
sinus headaches but differ

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.984
in the following ways.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.800
Migraines often start quickly,

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.696
sometimes with visual disturbances

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.776
called auras before the headache.

00:00:53.056 --> 00:00:54.872
The pain worsens rapidly and

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.920
usually resolves within 72 hours.

00:00:58.136 --> 00:00:59.352
Migraines often occur

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:00.976
more than once a month.
