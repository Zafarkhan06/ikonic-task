00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.560
If your child’s finger is fractured,

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:03.896
it means there is a crack

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:05.912
or break in the finger bone.

00:00:06.024 --> 00:00:07.856
Common causes include

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.048
the finger hitting or being hit

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.560
by a hard object,

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.320
getting slammed in a door,

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.424
or falling onto the hand.

00:00:15.632 --> 00:00:17.400
The break may involve the joint

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.216
where 2 finger bones meet

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.512
or the finger bone meets

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.424
the long bone in the hand.

00:00:22.648 --> 00:00:24.592
If the fracture is at the growth plate

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.008
near the end of the bone,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.848
bone growth can be affected,

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.984
and may require special X-rays

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.376
or other tests.

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.136
Young bones are more flexible

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:34.048
than an adult’s,

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.696
so a child’s bone may crack

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.744
or buckle without a clear break

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.328
instead of snapping like a dry stick.

00:00:40.528 --> 00:00:42.480
A fractured finger may be treated with

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.912
a splint for 2 to 6 weeks.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.608
Or it may only need to be taped

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.016
to the finger next to it,

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.360
called "buddy taping,"

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.664
without a splint.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.520
Surgery may be needed if

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.888
the fracture is large or crooked.
