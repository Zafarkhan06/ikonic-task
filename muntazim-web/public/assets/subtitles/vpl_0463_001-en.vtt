00:00:00.168 --> 00:00:02.336
Each of the hair follicles on your body

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:04.504
is connected to glands that secrete

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.544
an oily substance to lubricate

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.072
your skin and hair.

00:00:08.368 --> 00:00:11.568
To do that the substance, known as sebum,

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.544
needs to move up the hair shaft

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.872
and out the opening of the follicle.

00:00:16.464 --> 00:00:18.808
But sometimes the sebum acts

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.968
almost like a glue to dead cells

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.736
being shed by the skin.

00:00:22.904 --> 00:00:25.288
Together, they form a soft plug

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.824
that blocks the shaft,

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.304
while the sebaceous glands

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.376
continue to produce sebum.

00:00:31.048 --> 00:00:32.504
The growing blockage can

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.168
stimulate local bacteria like

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.440
staphylococcus to reproduce.

00:00:36.648 --> 00:00:38.632
Increasing bacteria leads to a

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.792
response by the immune system.

00:00:40.904 --> 00:00:42.488
A pimple is the visible

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.320
evidence of this process

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.672
white pus formed from sebum and

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.608
dead cells and bacteria,

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.688
and redness from inflammation 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.440
as the immune system tries to

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.160
kill the bacteria and heal the tissue.
