The first 3 weeks of pregnancy 

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.792

The sperm and egg unite

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.896
to form a single cell called a zygote.

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:16.016
The cell divides to form a cluster of cells

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.184
that travels down the Fallopian tube

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.552
