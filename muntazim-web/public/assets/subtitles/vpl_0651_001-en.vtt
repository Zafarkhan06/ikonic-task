00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.120
Your thyroid gland is located in your neck

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.816
under your Adamâ€™s apple.

00:00:04.928 --> 00:00:06.624
It is shaped like a butterfly with

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.288
one wing or lobe

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.136
on either side of the trachea,

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:11.840
which is your breathing tube.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.888
It is highly vascularized,

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.224
meaning there are many blood vessels.

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:19.784
This is because the thyroid gland produces hormones

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.544
that are carried throughout your body

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.192
through your blood stream.

00:00:23.336 --> 00:00:25.656
These hormones affect many aspects

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.232
of how your body functions,

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.840
such as your heart rate and metabolism.
