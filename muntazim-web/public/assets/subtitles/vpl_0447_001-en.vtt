00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.320
A bunion is a lump of

00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:02.920
bone and tissue on the outside

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.536
of the joint of the big toe.

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.120
It results from abnormal

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:06.904
stress on the joint

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.848
over an extended period of time.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.664
The stress causes enlargement

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.032
of the first metatarsal,

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.992
the bone that joins the big toe.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:15.608
This is a complex joint,

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.536
where bones, tendons, and ligaments

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.168
work together to transmit

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.368
and distribute your weight during movement.

00:00:21.504 --> 00:00:23.632
Wearing tight, high heeled shoes

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:24.896
pushes your bodyâ€™s weight

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.296
onto the front of the foot.

00:00:26.504 --> 00:00:28.608
Crowding pressure forces the big toe

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.976
toward the smaller toes

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.232
and the joint of the big toe outwards.

00:00:32.392 --> 00:00:34.230
This outward movement of the joint

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.200
starts the formation of a bunion.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.136
With continued stress on the joint,

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:39.872
the bunion becomes larger.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.000
The skin and tissue around the bunion

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.840
may become swollen and inflamed,

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.560
causing pain and making it difficult to walk.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.576
Conservative treatment for a bunion

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.952
includes wearing roomy,

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.280
wider toed shoes

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.752
and medication to relieve

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.160
pain and inflammation.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.288
In severe cases, surgery may be

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.848
performed to relieve pain,

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.176
remove the enlargement,

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.664
and realign the joint.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.184
Depending on the severity,

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.528
the surgery may simply

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.200
involve removing the extra bone

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.808
and realigning the muscles,

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.824
tendons, and ligaments of the joint.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.320
In more severe cases,

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.752
the bone may need to be cut

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.736
and moved into its proper position,

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.392
with insertion of screws,

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.176
wires, or plates to hold it

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.744
together while it heels.

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:19.952
Tendons and ligaments

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.712
may also need to be repositioned.

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.432
In some cases, an implant

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.080
may be required to reconstruct

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.040
or replace the joint of the big toe.
