00:00:00.648 --> 00:00:03.104
Your eyes work a lot like a camera.

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.280
The lens of a camera focuses light

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.144
onto the film inside.

00:00:07.312 --> 00:00:08.824
The cornea and lens in the

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:09.880
front of your eye

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.872
focus light onto the back,

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:13.408
where light-sensitive tissue

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.440
called the retina is located.

00:00:15.824 --> 00:00:18.032
When the retina receives an image,

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.576
it sends a signal through

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.296
the optic nerve to the brain

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:23.160
for the image to be developed.

00:00:23.296 --> 00:00:25.416
Presbyopia occurs with age

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.832
as the lens of the eye

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:28.536
becomes less elastic.

00:00:28.776 --> 00:00:30.656
Light rays focus behind

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.064
rather than directly on the retina.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.256
With this change,

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.016
close objects appear out of focus.
