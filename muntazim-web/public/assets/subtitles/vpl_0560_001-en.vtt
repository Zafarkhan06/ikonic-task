00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.352
Everyone has gasâ€”on average,

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.744
people produce 1 to 4 pints a day.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.824
Some gas in the digestive tract

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.048
comes from air you swallow.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.888
Other gas comes from breakdown of undigested food.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.992
After you swallow food,

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.552
it moves down the esophagus to the stomach,

00:00:19.552 --> 00:00:21.550
where it is partially digested.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.080
It moves on into the duodenum

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.528
and through the rest of the small intestine,

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.552
where most digestion and absorption occurs.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.240
However, a shortage or lack of certain enzymes

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.576
results in some carbohydrates not

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.832
being digested and absorbed.

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.264
Instead, the undigested food

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.408
passes into the large intestine,

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.144
where normal, harmless bacteria break it down.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.928
Byproducts of this process are hydrogen

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.584
and carbon dioxide.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.600
About a third of people also produce methane

00:00:53.616 --> 00:00:55.736
for reasons that are not clear.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.112
Accumulation of gas in the stomach,

00:00:58.112 --> 00:01:00.110
small intestine, or colon

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.832
can cause distension,

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.504
which means the abdomen is

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.776
objectively larger than normal.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.624
This is different from bloating,

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.416
which is the subjective feeling

00:01:09.416 --> 00:01:11.410
that the abdomen is larger.
