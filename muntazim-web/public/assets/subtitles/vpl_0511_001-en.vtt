00:00:00.192 --> 00:00:01.744
The lens in your eye

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.656
helps you to see objects clearly

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:06.112
both close up and far away.

00:00:06.272 --> 00:00:07.800
It focuses reflected light

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.720
from an object on the retina.

00:00:09.888 --> 00:00:12.080
The light is converted into nerve signals

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.496
that are sent to the brain,

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.048
which translates the signals into vision.

00:00:16.224 --> 00:00:18.088
Muscles change the curvature

00:00:18.088 --> 00:00:20.080
and focusing power of the lens

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.968
according to how far away an object is.

00:00:23.152 --> 00:00:24.424
As we get older,

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.528
the lens becomes less flexible

00:00:26.528 --> 00:00:28.520
and has more trouble curving steeply

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.328
when we look at something close up.

00:00:30.496 --> 00:00:31.960
This changes where light is

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.304
focused on the retina,

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.656
so close objects may appear blurry.

00:00:35.808 --> 00:00:38.384
This problem is called presbyopia.

00:00:38.576 --> 00:00:39.816
Another part of the eye that

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.152
changes with age is the iris.

00:00:42.224 --> 00:00:44.072
It consists mostly of muscle,

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.592
which controls the size of the

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:46.944
pupil at its center,

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.560
and therefore the amount of light

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:49.880
that passes through it.

00:00:50.016 --> 00:00:51.168
As we get older,

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.792
these muscles become weaker

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.736
and less able to respond quickly

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.088
to changes in light,

00:00:56.176 --> 00:00:57.768
which makes it harder to see

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:58.904
in dim light.

00:00:59.088 --> 00:01:01.136
Eyeglasses help the natural lens

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.680
to focus images correctly on the retina.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.856
Sometimes different lenses are required

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.696
to correct images from both near

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.496
and far objects.

00:01:09.992 --> 00:01:13.064
Contact lenses and permanent lens implants

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.216
can also be helpful

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.136
for correcting presbyopia.
