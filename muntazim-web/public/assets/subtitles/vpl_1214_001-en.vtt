00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.780
The sounds of the normal heartbeat

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.400
are the closing sounds of the valves.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.580
An extra sounds may be heard when

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.160
there is disease of the valve structures.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.060
This is called a heart murmur.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.760
This is a swishing sound caused by

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.040
blood flowing through a rigid valve

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.160
or flowing backward through a valve

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.500
that does not close properly. 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.280
Heart valves become diseased for many reasons

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.840
Including infections,

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:35.860
heart attacks,

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.700
Heart conditions since birth

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.860
and degeneration of the valves.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.780
Valve repair or replacement is performed

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.080
when a heart valve is tight and rigid,

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.900
or hard to open (stenosis),

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.760
or when it cannot close properly (regurgitation).

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.320
The mitral and aortic valves are most often effected.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.700
When valves do not open and close as they should

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.440
the work of the heart is greatly increased

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.900
as it works harder to pump the blood

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.900
through the diseased valve.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.620
This causes the heart muscle to enlarge

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.260
as it works harder.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.840
The overworked heart may eventually fail

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.220
causing heart failure symptoms.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.440
These symptoms include shortness of breath,

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.680
fatigue,

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.120
chest pain,

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.440
dizziness,

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.120
leg swelling.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.700
Medications can relieve heart failure temporarily.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.620
Surgery is often needed to improve heart function

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.300
and relieve the symptoms of heart failure.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.280
Valve repair or replacement

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.060
may be recommended before you feel these symptoms

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.200
if there are signs that the heart muscle is weakening.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.200
Aortic stenosis

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.620
is the narrowing of the aortic valve

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.480
that occurs over time.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.680
The leaflets cannot fully open

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.940
and your heart muscle must work harder

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.640
to move blood through the valve

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.160
to the rest of your body.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.220
In patients with mitral regurgitation

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.960
the mitral valve does not close properly

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.980
allowing blood to flow backwards

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.320
creating symptoms of shortness of breath,

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.980
fatigue and leg swelling.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.400
When possible,

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.200
your own mitral valve is repaired.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.080
If the valve leaflets have minimal damage

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.060
the damaged area can be repaired.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.060
If valve leaflets are severely damaged,

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.760
they cannot usually be repaired.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.220
During the surgery,

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.840
a transesophageal echocardiogram is performed

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.980
to look at the valve function after repair.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.280
If there is any chance the repair may not last,

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.000
the valve is then replaced during the same operation.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.940
The advantage of repairing the valve

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.880
is that the patient will not require

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.180
lifelong anticoagulation

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.040
and maintaining the structure of your own valve

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.100
is better than a prosthetic valve.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.200
The replacement valve will either be

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.280
a mechanical valve or a tissue valve.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.880
The tissue valve is bovine,

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.880
cow pericardium.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.260
Tissue valves are very similar to your own valve

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.820
and are well tolerated

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.720
and do not require lifelong blood thinning medication.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.100
The disadvantage of tissue valves

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.980
is that they are less durable than your own valves

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.180
or mechanical valves.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.640
Mechanical valves are the most durable

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.500
but are not natural to the body

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.160
and may cause blood clots to form.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.480
Lifelong blood thinning medication

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.800
is necessary to prevent blood clots from forming.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.060
Your preferences will be discussed

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.180
and considered while planning the operation.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.840
Some people feel better right away

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.840
after heart valve surgery.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.040
For most people,

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.040
it takes a few months to feel better after valve surgery.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.400
It takes time for the heart to recover

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.080
from the extra work it was doing before the surgery.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.120
Antibiotics will need to be taken before medical

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.880
or dental procedure for your lifetime.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.860
Bacteria can enter the blood stream during dental

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.020
and some surgical procedures

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:19.220
causing an infection in the tissues

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.160
surrounding the heart valve.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.680
This is called bacterial endocarditis.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.060
Notify your physician before any

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.340
dental or surgical procedures.
