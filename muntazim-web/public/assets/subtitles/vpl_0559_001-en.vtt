00:00:00.224 --> 00:00:02.904
Mucosa is moist tissue located

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.232
throughout your body,

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.320
which produces a thick liquid called mucus.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.784
Phlegm is a specific name for mucus

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.272
produced by respiratory mucosa,

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.072
the moist tissue lining the airways.

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.128
Tiny hair-like projections called cilia

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.736
move the mucus upward from the lungs,

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.712
through the windpipe or trachea

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.288
to the throat area behind the mouth.

00:00:25.496 --> 00:00:27.648
This area, called the pharynx,

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.264
receives air, food, and liquid.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.584
The respiratory and digestive systems

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.472
begin to divide into tubes

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.560
connecting with the lungs and stomach

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.920
at the larynx, or voicebox.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.520
The larynx is in the neck,

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.400
just below the tongue.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.776
Lung mucus either joins with

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.648
mucus flowing down from the nasal passages

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.584
to enter the esophagus and is swallowed,

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.928
or continues up the throat to be spat out.
