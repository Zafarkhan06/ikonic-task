00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:05.300
Insulin is necessary for cells in the body to take in glucose.

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.420
The liver both makes glucose from food

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.140
and stores glucose for later use as energy.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.040
Food comes into the body and is broken down into glucose,

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.120
which travels through the blood to be used as energy.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.520
The liver can also make glucose if the body needs it.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.620
When glucose enters the blood

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.880
the pancreas releases the right amount of a hormone called insulin

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.660
to balance the blood levels by delivering glucose

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.820
into the cells that need energy

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.580
and storing the extra.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.400
Problems can occur when there is no insulin,

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.540
not enough insulin, or the cells can't recognize insulin

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.140
and can't use the glucose for energy.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.220
Insulin, the medication,

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.600
regulates glucose the same way the hormone insulin does.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.280
Once in the bloodstream,

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.300
insulin binds to insulin receptors on the cell surface.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.280
This signals the cell to send glucose transporters to the cell's surface.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.300
This transport mechanism allows glucose to be taken into

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.780
the cell where it is used for energy.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.420
Removing blood glucose restores a normal balance

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.120
between blood glucose and insulin.
