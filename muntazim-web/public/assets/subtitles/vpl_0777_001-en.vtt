00:00:00.464 --> 00:00:04.736
The ankle is the joint connecting the foot to the leg.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.504
Many ligaments surround and stabilize this joint

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.280
by criss-crossing between the lower leg bones,

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.952
the tibia and fibula,

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:14.640
and the many bones of the foot, 

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.112
most notable, the talus.

00:00:17.336 --> 00:00:19.592
A sprained ankle usually occurs 

00:00:19.592 --> 00:00:21.590
from a rapid shifting movement,

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.056
or improper planting of your foot.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.424
Although common, ankle sprains can be serious.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.512
Do to the stretching and possible tearing of ligaments.

00:00:31.672 --> 00:00:34.168
The most common type of ankle sprain

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.088
is due to inversion or

00:00:36.088 --> 00:00:38.080
inward rolling of the foot.

00:00:38.208 --> 00:00:40.752
When this type of ankle sprain occurs,

00:00:40.784 --> 00:00:43.624
the outer ligaments are stretched too far

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.216
and often torn.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.752
The anterior talofibular ligament

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.712
is often the most commonly involved ligament

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.592
in this type of sprain.

00:00:52.952 --> 00:00:55.416
A less common type of ankle sprain

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.832
is called an eversion injury.

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.896
This is caused by an outward rolling of the foot,

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.688
and affects the medial side of the foot.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.472
When this occurs, the medial, or deltoid ligament

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.144
is stretched to the point of injury.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.088
A high ankle sprain is an injury to the

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.472
large ligaments above the ankle

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.416
that connect and stabilize the

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.728
two long bones of the lower leg,

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.848
the tibia and fibula.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.480
High ankle sprains commonly occur

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.312
from a sudden and forceful

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.408
outward twisting of the foot.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.768
This injury is often associated with

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.312
sports where contact and cutting is present.

00:01:34.464 --> 00:01:38.480
Ankle sprain symptoms can range from mild to severe

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.320
depending on the extensive damage to the ligaments

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.560
and surrounding soft tissues.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.880
Mild sprains may be swollen,

00:01:45.904 --> 00:01:47.448
tender and stiff,

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.560
but the ankle is usually stable 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.568
and able to support weight with little pain.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.312
More severe sprains include bruising,

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.792
increased tenderness and swelling.

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.768
The ankle is unsupported

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.408
do to ligament stretching

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.680
or tears and walking can be painful.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.272
For severe sprains, you may consult your doctor.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.720
Your doctor will diagnose the severity of your sprain

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.256
and might order x-rays in order to rule out a fracture.

00:02:15.368 --> 00:02:18.856
Complete tears of a ligament often heal naturally

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.576
and surgery is rarely required with ankle sprains.

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.736
Treatment of ankle sprains varies

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.016
according to the severity of the sprain

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.904
and aim to either reduce pain and swelling,

00:02:29.904 --> 00:02:31.900
or stabilize the ankle.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.496
Common treatment for a sprained ankle may include:

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.432
Icing the affected areas to reduce pain and swelling;

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.192
resting your ankle and using crutches;

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.816
anti-inflammatory pain killers such as

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.744
Ibuprofen, asprin or naproxen;

00:02:48.112 --> 00:02:50.008
Immobilization of the ankle;

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.120
via walking boots or compression bandages;

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.312
Stretching and strengthening exercises.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.912
Complete tears of a ligament often heal naturally

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.720
and surgery is rarely required with ankle sprains.
