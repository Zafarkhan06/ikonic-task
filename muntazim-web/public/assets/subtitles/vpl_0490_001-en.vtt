00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.208
Try to avoid lying on your back

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.600
while youâ€™re pregnant.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.568
After about the 4th month,

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.800
lying on your back puts the full weight of

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.776
your uterus and baby on the

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:12.424
inferior vena cava or IVC.

00:00:12.664 --> 00:00:14.448
This vessel carries blood from

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.024
your lower body back to your heart.

00:00:17.176 --> 00:00:20.304
The pressure of a pregnant uterus on the IVC

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.504
reduces blood flow to the heart,

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.176
which decreases blood flow to your uterus

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.880
and the developing baby.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.392
Lying on your back also puts pressure

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.736
on your spine, back muscles, and intestines.

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.160
Lying on your side

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.632
takes the pressure off the IVC.
