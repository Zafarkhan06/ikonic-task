00:00:00.608 --> 00:00:02.440
In heart valve replacement,

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.440
a natural valve in your heart

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.832
is surgically replaced

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:07.376
with an artificial one

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:08.736
because the natural valve

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.416
is not opening or closing all the way.

00:00:11.704 --> 00:00:13.712
Opening and closing of the four,

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.688
thin, flexible heart valves,

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.096
controls the flow of

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.000
blood with each heartbeat.

00:00:19.232 --> 00:00:21.968
The four valves are the Tricuspid valve,

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.584
the Pulmonic valve,

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.960
the Mitral valve,

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.656
and the Aortic valve.

00:00:27.352 --> 00:00:28.896
To replace a valve,

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.016
a surgeon makes a cut in the chest

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.584
and separates the sternum,

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:33.832
or breastbone.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.344
The heart is stopped

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.552
and then cut to reach the valve.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.288
A heart lung machine,

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.376
also called a bypass machine

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.048
takes over the work of the heart

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.912
and lungs during surgery.

00:00:45.272 --> 00:00:47.072
The faulty, natural valve

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.128
is removed and replaced.

00:00:49.304 --> 00:00:51.296
The cut in the heart is closed;

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:52.928
the heart is restarted;

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.064
the heart lung machine is removed;

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.680
and the chest incision is closed.
