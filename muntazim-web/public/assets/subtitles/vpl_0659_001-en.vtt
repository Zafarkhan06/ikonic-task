00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.344
A woman has a one in five chance 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.944
of developing a urinary tract infection

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.832
at some point during her life,

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.088
and many women have more than one.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.176
Your urinary system includes your

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.528
kidney, ureters, bladder, and urethra.

00:00:14.672 --> 00:00:16.696
The kidneys remove excess fluid

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:18.200
and waste from the blood,

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.664
which travels as urine through the ureters to the bladder.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.752
It is stored there and emptied through the urethra. 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.256
Along with fluid,

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.464
normal urine contains waste

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.552
and salts but it is sterile,

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.768
which means it usually does not contain

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.536
bacteria, viruses, and fungi.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.712
A urinary tract infection or UTI

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.456
begins when bacteria cling to the opening of the urethra

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.800
and start to multiply and travel up the urethra.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.264
The bacteria are usually a type called E. coli,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.480
which normally live in the colon.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.768
A UTI that affects only the urethra is called urethritis.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.672
Sometimes the bacteria move up

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.856
to the bladder and multiply there.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.128
This is called cystitis.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.944
Besides being annoying and painful,

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.056
a UTI needs to be treated

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.056
to keep the bacteria from moving up to the bladder.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.496
This is especially true for women.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.576
They have a shorter urethra,

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.616
which means the bacteria can reach

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.792
the bladder faster than in men.
