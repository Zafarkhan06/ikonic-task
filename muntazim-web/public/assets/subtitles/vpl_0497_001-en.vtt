00:00:00.256 --> 00:00:01.696
During childbirth,

00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:04.280
an incision may be made in the perineum

00:00:04.344 --> 00:00:06.272
the diamond shaped area that includes

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.072
the vagina and rectum.

00:00:08.256 --> 00:00:10.944
This incision, called an episiotomy,

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.632
used to be routine for vaginal delivery,

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:15.936
particularly a first delivery.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.912
The incision was thought to reduce

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.416
potential damage from a natural tear,

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.312
while making repair easier,

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:23.912
and speeding delivery.

00:00:24.072 --> 00:00:26.168
An episiotomy is no longer a

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.760
routine part of childbirth in the United States

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.792
and is usually done on a case by case basis.
