00:00:03.296 --> 00:00:05.536
Sleep apnea means not breathing

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:07.872
for 10 or more seconds while asleep.

00:00:08.168 --> 00:00:10.152
This disrupts the sleep cycle

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.312
and prevents a proper night’s sleep.

00:00:12.984 --> 00:00:15.000
It occurs when the relaxed tongue

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.016
blocks or narrows the airway.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.256
It can also occur if you have bone deformities

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.904
or larger than normal tissues

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.256
in your nose, mouth, or throat.

00:00:24.928 --> 00:00:27.232
Symptoms include loud snoring,

00:00:27.448 --> 00:00:28.912
daytime sleepiness,

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.016
and headaches.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.488
More severe apnea,

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:33.984
determined by how often

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.664
and how long you don’t breathe,

00:00:35.864 --> 00:00:37.440
may cause or worsen

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.320
high blood pressure

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.992
and coronary artery disease.
