00:00:00.408 --> 00:00:02.904
Inflammation results from the body’s normal

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.584
response to wounds and infection.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.888
Rheumatoid arthritis, or RA, is an autoimmune disease.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.936
This means the body’s immune system

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:14.728
mistakenly attacks itself,

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.208
causing inflammation

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.896
and destroying tissue and bone.

00:00:19.072 --> 00:00:21.984
RA mostly affects synovial joints.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.784
The ends of the bones are padded

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.544
by soft tissue called cartilage

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.704
and the whole joint is surrounded by an

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.496
envelope of tissue called a joint capsule,

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.200
which is lined with a synovial membrane.

00:00:34.672 --> 00:00:38.040
In early RA, joint tissue swells,

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.232
producing pain, stiffness, and redness.

00:00:41.352 --> 00:00:42.760
As it progresses,

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.328
the synovial membrane thickens.

00:00:45.504 --> 00:00:47.832
Growth of inflamed synovial tissue

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.264
begins as tissue normally produced for a healing wound.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.848
In RA this tissue, called pannus,

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.736
can grow to invade and destroy cartilage and bone.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.840
In addition, inflamed cells can release

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.904
enzymes that digest bone and cartilage.

00:01:05.056 --> 00:01:06.840
With continued destruction,

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.800
bone joints no longer line up as they should.

00:01:09.928 --> 00:01:12.448
Then loss of muscle tissue occurs,

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.104
with visible deformity.

00:01:14.336 --> 00:01:16.304
The invading tissue may harden,

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.216
so the joint cannot move.

00:01:18.408 --> 00:01:22.176
The hands, feet, wrists and other small joints

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.952
are most commonly affected

00:01:24.352 --> 00:01:27.248
but RA can spread to anywhere in the body.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.904
Treatment is directed toward

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.288
reducing inflammation and pain

00:01:31.512 --> 00:01:34.816
and preventing deformity and further joint destruction;

00:01:34.992 --> 00:01:37.176
the goal is the lowest possible level

00:01:37.176 --> 00:01:41.496
of disease activity and if possible, remission. 

00:01:42.008 --> 00:01:44.792
Consulting a rheumatologist about treatment options

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.560
is important for anyone with RA.
