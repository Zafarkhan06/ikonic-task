00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.680
Spores contained in uncooked 

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.168
or poorly cooked meat from an animal

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.096
infected with anthrax,

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.984
are swallowed and carried into the stomach

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.616
and intestines.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.256
There the spores attatch to the

00:00:14.256 --> 00:00:16.250
small folds and wrinkles

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.896
of the stomach lining.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.960
A type of white blood cell,

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.896
a macrophage, one of the bodies protection units,

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.536
engulfs the intruding spore.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.312
The anthrax spore

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.488
germinates inside the macrophage.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.784
The rod-shaped bacillis

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.608
emerges from the spore

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.248
with a capsule that protects it from being eaten.

00:00:39.592 --> 00:00:42.064
The bacilli multiply rapidly

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.840
within the macrophage,

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.312
and produce two kinds of toxins;

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.704
called lethal factor and edema factor.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.024
Finally, overwhelmed by the number of basili within it,

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.168
the macrophage bursts,

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.152
releasing the anthrax bacilli and its toxins.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.072
They spread from the stomach

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.504
into either the abdominal mesentery,

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.968
or the lymph nodes.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.400
Then to the heart

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.840
and into the circulatory system.

00:01:10.224 --> 00:01:12.464
There may be an ulcer at the site of

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.584
former entry with infection

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.792
and destruction of the draining lymph glands.
