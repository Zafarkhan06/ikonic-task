00:00:00.224 --> 00:00:03.800
Lymph nodes are tiny glands shaped like beans.

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.112
They are located throughout your body,

00:00:06.136 --> 00:00:09.352
with most being situated in your head and neck.

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:12.320
Lymph node filter a fluid called Lymph.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.200
It begins as the fluid that 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.480
bathes all the cells in your body

00:00:16.528 --> 00:00:19.864
and then enters a network called Lymphatic vessels,

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.072
where it constantly circulates.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.664
It enters the Lymph nodes to be filtered.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.704
Before leaving to return to circulation.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.136
Most of the cells in Lymphoid tissue 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.640
are white blood cells,

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.568
Immune system cells called Lymphocytes,

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.280
and Macrophages.

00:00:36.592 --> 00:00:40.680
Dendridic cells ingest foreign cells, like bacteria,

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.128
and in doing so,

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.256
leave small particles of the cells

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.856
called antigens on their surface.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.184
Lymphocytes called T-cells become activated

00:00:50.256 --> 00:00:53.976
when they encounter the antigens on the macrophage surface.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.184
The activated T-cells stimulate

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.600
other Lymphocytes called B-cells

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.640
to produce antibodies against

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.432
the invading particles.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.824
Once activated, B-cells move to a site

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.376
inside the Lymph node.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.688
Where they multiply to produce more antibodies.

00:01:10.848 --> 00:01:13.656
When B-cells are multiplying and antibodies are

00:01:13.656 --> 00:01:15.650
being produced to fight infection,

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.760
Lymph nodes often get bigger

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.760
and tender to the touch.
