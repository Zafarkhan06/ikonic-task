00:00:00.328 --> 00:00:02.528
During Week 5 of pregnancy,

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.800
or 3 weeks after conception,

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.968
the dividing cells of the embryo

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.112
form a disk,

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:10.600
which folds into 3 layers.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.624
These layers are the beginnings of

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.328
the organization of cells

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.184
that will develop into all of the

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.808
organs and tissues of the human body.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.840
A groove forms down the center of the disk,

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.024
which now has a top and bottom,

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.576
front and back, and left and right side. 

00:00:27.808 --> 00:00:32.032
This neural groove deepens and then forms a tube,

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.376
which will develop into the brain and spinal cord.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.152
An early circulatory system develops from

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.184
tubes on the left and right side of the groove.

00:00:41.384 --> 00:00:45.176
The tubes merge, kink, and fuse together

00:00:45.176 --> 00:00:47.170
to form the chambers of the heart,

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.928
which will begin to beat and pump blood.

00:00:50.128 --> 00:00:53.016
The central nervous system is also developing

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.328
and the gastrointestinal tract begins to form.

00:00:56.544 --> 00:01:00.920
Simultaneously, the surrounding environment is also changing

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.744
to nourish, protect, and support this development.
