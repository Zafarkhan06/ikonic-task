00:00:00.192 --> 00:00:01.920
The outer layer of your skin,

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.344
called the epidermis,

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:05.096
is supported by the elastic

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:07.352
middle layer, called the dermis.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.416
The dermis is designed to stretch

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:10.528
and bounce back,

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:11.976
but rapid weight gain,

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.296
pregnancy, and other factors sometimes

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:16.432
cause it to tear instead.

00:00:16.536 --> 00:00:19.040
The tearing causes lines like scars

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.424
called stretch marks to

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.208
form on the epidermis.

00:00:22.392 --> 00:00:24.312
The marks appear as parallel

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.200
reddish or purplish lines,

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.904
which gradually fade.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.752
They typically occur in areas

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.464
where large amounts of fat are stored.
