00:00:00.336 --> 00:00:02.616
Edema means swelling from fluid

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.312
that accumulates and is trapped

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:05.960
in your bodyâ€™s tissues.

00:00:06.264 --> 00:00:09.024
Edema most commonly occurs in the feet,

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.440
ankles, and legs but any part of

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.128
the body can be affected.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:14.896
The tissues of your body

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:16.584
are made up of cells held

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.680
together by connective tissue.

00:00:18.936 --> 00:00:20.696
The space between cells that

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:22.432
contain connective tissue and

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.336
tiny blood vessels is called the interstitium.

00:00:25.408 --> 00:00:27.432
The fluids in your body that are not

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.344
inside cells are usually stored in your blood vessels

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.992
and what are called the interstitial spaces,

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.432
meaning not inside cells.

00:00:36.576 --> 00:00:39.640
Edema occurs when the tiny blood vessels

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.776
or capillaries leak fluid

00:00:41.776 --> 00:00:44.360
into the surrounding tissue spaces.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.224
When the interstitial spaces fill with fluid,

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.248
they expand and the area swells.

00:00:50.376 --> 00:00:52.536
There are two kinds of edema.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.856
In the type called pitting edema,

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.320
applying pressure to the swollen area

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.656
causes an indentation that persists

00:00:59.656 --> 00:01:01.650
after the pressure is released.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.536
In non-pitting edema,

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.744
there is no persistent indentation

00:01:05.744 --> 00:01:07.740
after pressure is applied.
