00:00:01.752 --> 00:00:04.096
Severe or complete ruptures

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:06.496
may require surgery to suture 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:08.808
the ends of the tendon back together,

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.968
and a cast, splint, or walking boot

00:00:11.984 --> 00:00:15.200
to keep the joint stabilized while it heals.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.600
With physical therapy to stretch

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.152
and strengthen your muscles and tendon,

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.720
you may be completely rehabilitated

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.992
in 4 to 6 months.

00:00:25.416 --> 00:00:28.328
To prevent injury to your Achilles tendon,

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.624
remember to properly warm up and stretch

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.264
before intense physical activity,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.856
and stretch again afterwards.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.840
In particular, stretch your calf muscle 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.032
until you feel a pull but no pain,

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.216
and do not bounce during the stretch.
