00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.128
Urinary stress incontinence is a common condition

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.016
that affects up to 60% of all women.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.624
It occurs when the bladder leaks during normal,

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.272
everyday physical activity,

00:00:10.304 --> 00:00:12.344
such as coughing, sneezing, 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.920
laughing, or lifting heavy objects.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.200
Stress incontinence is caused by weak

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.864
pelvic floor muscles that can support the bladder

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.720
and keep the urethra closed to prevent leaking.

00:00:22.944 --> 00:00:25.704
During tension-free vaginal tape surgery

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.440
a ribbon of synthetic mesh tape

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.352
is positioned under the urethra

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.120
like a sling to maintain its normal position

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.976
and stop leaks during everyday activities.

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.592
Potential risks of the surgery include,

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.136
changes in the vagina,

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.176
damage to the urethra, bladder, or vagina,

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:43.976
erosion of the surgical tape,

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.240
irritable bladder,

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.824
difficulty urinating,

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.728
and increased urine leakage.
