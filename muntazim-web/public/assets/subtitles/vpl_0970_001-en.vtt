00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:06.160
Beta-agonists are medications that selectively stimulate beta receptors.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.820
Beta-1 receptors are found in the heart,

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.500
while beta-2 receptors are found in the lungs and bronchial airways.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.840
In the body, natural chemicals can stimulate

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.920
the receptors in the heart to increase the heartbeat

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.520
and the squeezing force of heart muscle to increase

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.800
blood flow while in the lungs.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.080
Stimulation of the receptors causes the lung airway

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.960
muscle cells to relax.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.120
Opening the airways and increase airflow through the lungs.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.720
Beta-agonists can be selective

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.800
when attaching and stimulating the same receptors

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.820
as the natural chemicals.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.960
They may be used to stimulate the heart to work harder

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.140
or to increase airflow into the lungs.
