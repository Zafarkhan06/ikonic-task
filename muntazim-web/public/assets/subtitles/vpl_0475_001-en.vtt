When you swallow a pill,

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:03.568
what happens to it?

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.184
After being swallowed,

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.552
a pill travels down the esophagus,

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.848
which connects the mouth to the stomach.

00:00:10.048 --> 00:00:12.152
Once the pill reaches the stomach,

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.296
stomach acid dissolves it. 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:16.288
The dissolved medication passes

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.912
from the stomach into the small intestine.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.112
It is then absorbed into the blood vessels

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.296
surrounding the small intestine.

00:00:23.584 --> 00:00:26.136
Once the medication enters the blood stream,

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.104
it circulates and is carried to

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.528
all the organs of the body

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.528
to help the healing process.
