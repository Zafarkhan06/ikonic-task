00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.960
Your pancreas is shaped like a fish.

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.568
It stretches across the back of your abdomen,

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.008
behind your stomach.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.280
Many people know about the pancreas

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.104
in relation to diabetes,

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.664
because it makes the hormone insulin.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.640
But the pancreas is a dual function organ

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.416
that makes digestive enzymes as well as hormones.

00:00:20.416 --> 00:00:22.410
Once food is in your stomach,

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.120
it is churned and mixed with a highly acidic

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.856
gastric juice produced in the stomach lining.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.664
This mixture moves into the small intestine,

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.032
where it mixes with juices from the pancreas and liver.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.200
The juice produced by the pancreas

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.312
contains enzymes to further break down the food.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.120
It also contains sodium bicarbonate,

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.160
which neutralizes acid in the

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.880
partially digested food from the stomach.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.872
The pancreatic juice flows into a tube

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.728
called the pancreatic duct,

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.320
which joins another tube called the common bile duct. 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.656
The common bile duct also carries bile.

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.744
This digestive juice is produced by the liver

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.568
and stored in the gallbladder.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.736
As food is dissolved by digestive juices,

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.840
it is mixed and pushed forward

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.536
into the small intestine

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.280
for further digestion and absorption.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.408
Digested nutrients are absorbed

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.600
through the walls of the small intestine.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.984
Solid waste products are pushed into the colon,

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.880
where water is removed

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.608
and they remain as feces

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.928
until expelled in a bowel movement.
