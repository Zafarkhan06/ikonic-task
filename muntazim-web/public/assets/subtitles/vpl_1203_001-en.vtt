00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.060
Multiple Sclerosis, or MS,

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.000
is a disease in which your immune system

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.800
attacks the protective covering of nerve cells.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.420
This protective covering is called the myelin sheath.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.940
Without this protective covering your nerves are damaged.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.840
This damage disrupts the communication between your brain and body.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.260
What causes the immune system to attack the myelin sheath is unknown.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.360
Nerves in any part of your brain,

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.800
spine, or eyes can be damaged.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.280
Multiple sclerosis causes many different symptoms.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.900
Some symptoms include:

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.300
Pain, Tingling or numbness,

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.580
Loss of movement and balance,

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:38.940
Vision loss,

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.120
Speech problems,

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.740
Muscle weakness.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.660
Symptoms vary from person to person.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.780
Some people can be symptom free or have mild symptoms

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.780
while others can have severe symptoms

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.240
that make doing daily tasks difficult.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.860
Although there is no cure for MS,

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.080
MS, there are medicines that can help with symptoms

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.140
and slow the disease progression.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.200
A physical therapist can also teach you

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.380
exercises to keep your strength and balance.
