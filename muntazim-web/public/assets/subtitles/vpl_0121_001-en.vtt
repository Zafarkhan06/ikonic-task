00:00:00.296 --> 00:00:02.560
The primary treatment for diabetes

00:00:02.584 --> 00:00:04.912
is often giving the body more insulin.

00:00:05.176 --> 00:00:07.192
There are different types of insulin,

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.136
including short-acting, or regular,

00:00:10.776 --> 00:00:14.160
intermediate-acting or NPH, lente,

00:00:14.576 --> 00:00:17.136
and long-acting, or ultralente.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.608
The short-acting and longer acting

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.096
types are often combined

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.592
in a single dose.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.112
Insulin is injected under the skin

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.616
of the thigh, arm, or abdomen.

00:00:27.808 --> 00:00:29.264
These shots may be done from

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.704
1 to 4 or more times a day.

00:00:31.992 --> 00:00:33.312
Here’s how to give yourself

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:34.616
an insulin shot:

00:00:35.072 --> 00:00:36.944
Clean the skin where you’ll give yourself

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.024
the shot with an alcohol swab.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.152
Gently pinch the skin

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.592
and then insert the needle

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.496
at a 45 degree angle.

00:00:44.728 --> 00:00:46.040
Gently and steadily

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.440
push down on the plunger

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.032
to inject all the solution

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.120
under the skin.

00:00:50.672 --> 00:00:52.856
Withdraw the needle and syringe.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.872
Use the alcohol swab to

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.248
press down on the area

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.120
where you gave yourself the shot.

00:00:58.576 --> 00:00:59.984
Anyone using insulin

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.472
to lower their blood sugar

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:02.936
must also be sure to follow

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.672
their healthcare provider's directions

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.456
for checking their blood sugar.
