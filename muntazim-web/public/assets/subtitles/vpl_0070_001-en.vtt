The redness, soreness, itching,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.480
and sometimes blistering

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.024
that occurs with sunburn

00:00:06.112 --> 00:00:07.960
results from too much exposure

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.952
to the ultraviolet, or UV,

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.192
rays of the sun or a sunlamp.

00:00:12.568 --> 00:00:14.072
To prevent sunburn,

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.272
use sunscreen with a

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.952
sun protection factor, or SPF,

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:19.936
of 15 or greater.

00:00:20.184 --> 00:00:21.664
Sunscreens differ,

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.520
so use one that protects against

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.456
both UVA and UVB rays.

00:00:26.696 --> 00:00:29.072
Sunburn has many harmful effects

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.256
including long-term skin damage

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.624
and increased risk of skin cancer.

00:00:33.856 --> 00:00:35.568
Even without sunburn,

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.136
too much sun leads to

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.432
faster skin aging with wrinkles,

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.024
sagging, and brown sunspots.
