00:00:00.976 --> 00:00:02.544
The column of bones called

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:04.576
vertebrae make up your spine.

00:00:04.624 --> 00:00:05.952
These bones are named

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:07.680
based on their location.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.064
The cervical vertebrae are in your neck.

00:00:10.192 --> 00:00:11.576
The thoracic vertebrae

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.008
are in your upper back,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.432
and the lumbar vertebrae

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:15.992
are in your lower back.

00:00:16.176 --> 00:00:18.008
The hollow space in the vertebrae

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.576
called the spinal canal

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.608
surrounds the spinal cord.

00:00:21.864 --> 00:00:23.576
Stenosis means

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.768
the spinal canal has narrowed,

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.488
reducing the area for the spinal cord.

00:00:28.576 --> 00:00:30.776
This narrowing increases pressure

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.184
on nerves coming off of the spinal cord

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.656
and can cause back pain, or numbness,

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.072
weakness, or pain in the leg.

00:00:38.424 --> 00:00:40.368
Stenosis is most common

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.744
in the lumbar region

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.912
but may also occur in the cervical

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.760
or thoracic region of the spinal column.
