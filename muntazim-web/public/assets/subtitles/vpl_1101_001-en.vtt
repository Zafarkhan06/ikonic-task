00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.700
The bladder is where urine is stored.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.880
It has a small tube that allows

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.360
urine to leave the body,

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.360
known as the urethra.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.120
Beneath the bladder are muscles

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.120
that make up the pelvic floor,

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.680
they help support the bladder

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.980
and keep urine from leaking.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.880
During urination the pelvic floor relaxes

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.940
while bladder muscle contracts in order to expel urine.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.520
For people with overactive bladder,

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.180
the bladder muscle contracts

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.180
even when the bladder isnâ€™t full.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.540
This leads to that sudden urge to urinate

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.220
that may be difficult to control

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.720
and ultimately urine loss.
