00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:02.536
The knee acts like a hinge

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:04.032
and a shock absorber when you

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:07.400
walk, run, jump, kick, or climb.

00:00:07.664 --> 00:00:10.128
Ligaments, tendons, and muscles

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.712
give the knee stability

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:13.104
and hold it together.

00:00:13.472 --> 00:00:15.728
Rubbery tissue called cartilage

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.608
covers and cushions the ends of

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.520
the bones that make up the knee.

00:00:19.696 --> 00:00:22.688
These bones include the femur, or thighbone,

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.568
the tibia, or shinbone,

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.784
and the patella, or knee cap.

00:00:27.112 --> 00:00:29.200
Osteoarthritis of the knee

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.040
means the cartilage in the joint

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.304
has broken down

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.792
because of excessive wear

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.016
due to obesity, injuries, or overuse.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.288
It is also called degenerative arthritis

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.888
and degenerative joint disease, or DJD.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.192
When knee cartilage is rough,

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.952
frayed or worn away,

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.288
the bones can grind against each other,

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.824
which can make the knee joint

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.656
irritated, painful, and swollen.
