00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:03.850
The liver makes a liquid called bile

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:06.620
to break down fats during digestion.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.160
Bile is stored in the gallbladder,

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.650
a pouch-like organ that

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.700
lies on the underside of the liver.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.340
When bile is needed for digestion,

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.430
it flows from the gall bladder

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.030
through the cystic duct

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:20.870
and common bile duct

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.400
into the first part of the small intestine.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.450
Substances in bile,

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.230
most commonly cholesterol,

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.240
may collect to form stones

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.230
which can block the flow of bile.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.320
This blockage can lead to painful inflammation

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.120
or cholecystitis,

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:37.810
which is usually treated by

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.690
surgical removal of the gall bladder and stones

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.750
in a procedure called a cholecystectomy.
