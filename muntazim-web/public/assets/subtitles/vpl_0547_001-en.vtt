00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.840
A strong pain in the lower right area

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.656
of the abdomen can be a sign of appendicitis,

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:08.224
which means an inflamed appendix.

00:00:08.432 --> 00:00:11.152
The appendix is a small, worm-like organ

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:12.800
that sits at the beginning of the large

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.408
bowel on the right side,

00:00:14.584 --> 00:00:16.136
just where the small intestine

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:18.280
empties its stool contents.

00:00:18.464 --> 00:00:20.392
If food or a small piece of

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.648
stool blocks the opening of the appendix,

00:00:22.728 --> 00:00:25.016
it can become infected and inflamed

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:26.488
and fill with pus.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.168
This puts pressure on the walls of the appendix

00:00:29.248 --> 00:00:31.112
and blocks the tiny blood vessels

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:32.664
that supply it with oxygen.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.816
The walls become weaker and,

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:35.944
if not treated,

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.080
the tissue may become necrotic,

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.048
which means that it dies.

00:00:40.192 --> 00:00:42.536
If the weakened walls burst or rupture,

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.912
the contents spill into the abdominal cavity,

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.208
which becomes inflamed and infected.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.256
This dangerous condition is called peritonitis

00:00:50.256 --> 00:00:52.250
and may be life-threatening.
