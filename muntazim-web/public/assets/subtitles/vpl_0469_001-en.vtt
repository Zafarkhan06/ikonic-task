00:00:00.304 --> 00:00:01.728
Your sense of movement

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:03.688
and balance is based on your body’s

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.152
vestibular system,

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:06.888
which keeps track of the motion

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.632
and position of your head.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.664
Vision contributes some of this information,

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.640
but most is based on structures

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:14.824
called labyrinths

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:15.832
in the inner ear

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.624
on both sides of your head.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.848
When you move forward and back,

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.408
or from side to side,

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.664
or speed up or slow down,

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.536
fluid inside canals in the

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.544
labyrinth changes position.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.320
There are three canals,

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.640
oriented differently,

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.272
to sense movements in three dimensions,

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.752
such as: turning around in circles,

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.392
nodding, or doing a cartwheel.

00:00:38.896 --> 00:00:40.616
At the base of each canal

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.040
is a small swelling with

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.648
hairs projecting up.

00:00:43.888 --> 00:00:45.328
When the fluid moves,

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.536
the hairs move,

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.304
and nerve signals are sent to the brain.

00:00:49.824 --> 00:00:51.528
Motion sickness occurs

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.832
when there is a disagreement

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.456
between what you visually perceive as movement,

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.512
and what is perceived by your body’s

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.992
vestibular system.
