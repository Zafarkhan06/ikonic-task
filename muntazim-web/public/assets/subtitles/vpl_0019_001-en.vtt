00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.330
To understand how we hear,

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:04.690
and how some common problems occur,

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:07.450
it helps to understand ear anatomy.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.990
Your ear canal is connected to the

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.460
tympanic membrane, or eardrum,

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.490
which senses sound waves entering your ear.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:17.760
Inside the ear canal,

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.570
wax is created to remove

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.430
dust particles from the air

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.280
before they reach the tympanic membrane.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.780
But wax buildup can also prevent

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:28.620
sound waves from reaching it.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.040
Using a Q tip can push the wax

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.780
in deeper and worsen the problem.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.430
When sound waves do reach the tympanic membrane,

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:38.640
it vibrates,

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.630
which causes small bones in the middle of your ear,

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.000
called the ossicles,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.980
to shake.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.020
They may be blocked from moving

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.990
if an infection in your middle ear

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.820
causes a build up fluid and

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.280
bulging of the tympanic membrane.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.550
The motion of the inner ear bones

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.340
produces pressure waves,

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.010
which set in motion tiny

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.910
hair fibers in the inner ear

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.130
or cochlea.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.450
The inner ear hairs convert

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.930
their motion into electrical signals,

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.030
which are carried to the part of the brain

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.620
that perceives sound.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.390
Listening to loud music

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.150
can shear the hair cells,

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.440
so that they tear and shrivel.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.190
This is a primary cause of hearing loss,

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:19.930
especially when there is too much

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.780
noise in the environment.
