00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:03.640
Microdermabrasion and dermabrasion

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.400
are procedures that resurface your skin.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.920
This means they remove the outer layers of your skin,

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.900
so that new skin can grow.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.340
They may sound similar but have major differences.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.360
During microdermabrasion,

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.040
a dermatologist or skin care specialist

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.200
removes dead or dying skin cells

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.960
in the top layer of your skin (the epidermis)

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.620
to make it look fresher.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.000
They use a fine abrasive tip or crystals

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.600
to exfoliate and a vacuum to remove dead skin.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.360
Right after microdermabrasion,

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.480
you can expect your skin to feel renewed and refreshed.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.440
Dermabrasion is a serious procedure

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.840
done by a medical professional.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.580
Your doctor will use a wire brush

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.400
or rotating wheel with a sandpaper-like surface

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.460
to remove the top layer of your skin (the epidermis)

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.260
and part of the second layer (the dermis).

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.620
This will make new skin grow.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.880
You will be sedated before dermabrasion.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.080
After, your skin may form a “crust”

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.520
or scab for 1-2 weeks.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.840
Your skin will appear red, swollen, or irritated.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.980
Once the scab falls off, you’ll see new skin.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.120
Your doctor will explain

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.960
how to care for your skin while it heals.
