00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.320
An epidural steroid injection

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.880
delivers medicine into the epidural space

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.808
that surrounds the spinal cord.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.664
To help alleviate pain caused by irritated nerves.

00:00:11.168 --> 00:00:14.520
The spine is made up of bones called vertebrae.

00:00:14.656 --> 00:00:17.424
Between each vertebra is a fibrous disk

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.080
with a jell-like center.

00:00:19.544 --> 00:00:22.136
This disk can rupture or bulge,

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.512
causing inflammation or pressure on the spinal nerves.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.224
Resulting in pain, tingling or numbness.

00:00:29.728 --> 00:00:33.512
An epidural steroid injection, or ESI,

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.800
may be recommended to relieve pain caused by inflammation.

00:00:38.168 --> 00:00:40.904
The medication, a corticosteroid,

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.992
is injected in the epidural space

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.152
between the bony arch of the vertebra

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.248
and the dura, the thick covering of the spinal cord.

00:00:49.656 --> 00:00:51.136
The injection may include

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.760
local anesthetic and/or saline

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.360
along with the corticosteroid medication

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.408
to give immediate pain relief

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.760
and flush the area of inflammatory agents.

00:01:02.176 --> 00:01:04.800
The corticosteroid works to relieve pain

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.064
by reducing the inflammation and swelling

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.368
around the spinal nerve roots.

00:01:09.936 --> 00:01:12.584
Corticosteroids enter cells and bind

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.872
to receptors in the cytoplasm.

00:01:15.048 --> 00:01:18.080
The combination of corticosteroid and receptor

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.360
enters the cell nucleus, where it works to

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.360
control the production of proteins.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.584
Including enzymes that cause inflammation.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.728
By blocking the production of those enzymes

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.432
inflammation and swelling in the area around

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:32.896
the herniated disk

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.920
and the pain associated with it,

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.608
may be reduced.

00:01:37.296 --> 00:01:39.344
Sometimes there are multiple areas of

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.048
potential nerve compression

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.144
or potential sources of pain,

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.520
and the injections are often used as

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.352
diagnostic tests to find the right source of pain.

00:01:49.592 --> 00:01:51.472
If you inject the right spot

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.176
and the pain is reduced,

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.592
then it must be the source of the pain.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.576
Thus, it is important to keep a diary of the

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.800
pain relief after the injection.

00:02:01.112 --> 00:02:03.032
As with all medical procedures,

00:02:03.032 --> 00:02:05.030
there are potential risks.

00:02:05.216 --> 00:02:08.968
Potential risks of an epidural steroid injection include:

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.096
Infection,

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.792
Dural puncture,

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.664
Bleeding,

00:02:12.848 --> 00:02:14.208
Nerve damage.

00:02:14.584 --> 00:02:17.008
Certain medicines may need to be stopped

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.568
prior to your procedure.

00:02:18.816 --> 00:02:22.024
Talk with your doctor about any medicines you are taking.

00:02:22.424 --> 00:02:25.240
For 3 days before your procedure

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.768
please stop all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, NSAIDs.

00:02:31.552 --> 00:02:34.048
For 7 days before your procedure,

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.712
please stop aspirin, or any medicine containing aspirin,

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.384
any herbal medicine,

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.896
or any over the counter medicines.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.744
Please speak to your doctor before

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.128
setting up your procedure,

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.960
if you are taking any blood thinning medicine.

00:02:48.272 --> 00:02:50.376
Please call the spine clinic staff

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.792
the week before your procedure if you

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.392
have allergies to or problems with:

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:56.536
Iodine,

00:02:56.768 --> 00:02:58.272
contrast dye,

00:02:58.424 --> 00:02:59.760
steroids,

00:02:59.944 --> 00:03:01.536
numbing medicines,

00:03:01.712 --> 00:03:03.040
latex,

00:03:03.672 --> 00:03:05.304
have been feeling sick,

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.776
or have had an infection of any kind,

00:03:07.904 --> 00:03:09.728
or have been placed on antibiotics

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.888
within the month before your procedure,

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.032
have had 3 or more steroid injections

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.752
within the 12 months before your procedure,

00:03:18.144 --> 00:03:21.312
are pregnant or could likely be pregnant.

00:03:21.896 --> 00:03:23.672
It is not required that you have

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.200
someone to drive you home,

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.200
but it is a good idea.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.944
You may have temporary arm or leg numbness

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.824
for up to 5 hours after your procedure.

00:03:33.224 --> 00:03:34.992
If you have diabetes,

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.328
please check your fasting blood sugar

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.888
on the day of your visit, before you come.

00:03:40.168 --> 00:03:41.632
After your procedure,

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.288
check your fasting blood sugar

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.736
4 times a day

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.688
for the next 3 days.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.880
The medicine given to you during your procedure

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.376
may raise your blood sugar levels.

00:03:51.688 --> 00:03:53.704
please check in 15 minutes 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.712
before your scheduled visit time.
