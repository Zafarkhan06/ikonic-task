00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.496
People can become infected with

00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:03.128
tapeworms by eating food

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.048
or drinking water contaminated with

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.768
tapeworm eggs or larvae.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.824
In the US, most infections are

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.464
caused by eating undercooked

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.448
or raw, contaminated pork,

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.512
beef, or freshwater fish.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:16.464
If you eat meat containing the larval

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:17.768
form of the tapeworm,

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.400
the larval cysts hatch

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.584
and develop into adult

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.120
worms in your intestine.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.936
Some types attach themselves

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.384
to the wall of the intestine,

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.224
grow, and produce eggs.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.584
Others exit your body with stool.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.728
An adult tapeworm

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.200
can live up to 20 years

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.424
and grow to 50 feet in length.

00:00:34.768 --> 00:00:37.208
Larvae can penetrate the intestinal wall

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.336
and travel out of your

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:39.768
intestine to other tissue

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.384
such as your lungs or liver,

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.088
where they can form cysts.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.624
Tapeworms in the intestine

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.304
often cause no symptoms.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.360
Sometimes pieces of the tapeworm

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.880
are excreted in stool.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.384
Other signs and symptoms

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.624
include nausea, abdominal pain, and diarrhea.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.216
Tapeworm larvae that move out of

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.832
the intestine and form cysts

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:59.472
in other tissue can cause

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.048
organ and tissue damage.

00:01:01.168 --> 00:01:03.120
Cysts in the brain can cause headaches,

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.776
seizures, and other neurological symptoms.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.608
Treatment includes medication to

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.176
kill tapeworms and corticosteroids.
