00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.940
Petechial hemorrhage refers to the appearance of small,

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.480
pinpoint-sized red or purple spots on the skin,

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.720
mucous membranes, or even internal organs.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.560
These dots are called petechiae.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.440
Petechiae are caused by tiny amounts of bleeding

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.580
from small blood vessels known as capillaries. 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.000
There are many potential causes of petechial hemorrhaging,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.640
but we will focus on petechiae formation

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.900
due to strangulation.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.700
During strangulation,

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.160
the jugular veins and carotid arteries,

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.640
which are found next to each other,

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.780
are typically both obstructed.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.880
When the jugular veins are blocked,

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.880
blood cannot leave the head.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.600
Although the carotid arteries,

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.140
bringing blood into the head, may be blocked,

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.720
a second set of vessels,

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.880
called the vertebral arteries,

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.420
may still allow blood to enter.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.740
When this happens,

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.020
blood pressure increases in the head

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.720
as blood enters but cannot leave.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.360
As pressure builds in the capillaries,

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.120
the vessels burst open,

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.080
releasing small amounts of blood

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.080
into the surrounding tissue.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.740
Petechiae may develop with pressure build-up

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.920
in as little as ten seconds.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.540
As the blockage continues

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.220
and more pressure builds,

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.060
more petechiae are formed

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.440
until they cover the entire face.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.320
This is known as florid petechial hemorrhage

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.220
and is often seen when someone has been

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.000
rendered unconscious or dead.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.240
If the vertebral arteries are blocked

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.960
in addition to the carotids,

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.980
no blood is entering or leaving the head.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.020
In this case,

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.720
pressure does not build in the blood vessels

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.840
and no petechial hemorrhaging occurs.
