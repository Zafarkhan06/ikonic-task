00:00:02.048 --> 00:00:04.776
Excessive strain on the Achilles tendon 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.632
may cause it to tear.

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.088
Intense physical activity involving 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.696
pushing off from the ground

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.480
or pointing your toe down,

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.776
strains the Achilles tendon.

00:00:15.128 --> 00:00:16.816
If the tendon is weak,

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.360
or the calf muscles have not 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.168
been warmed up and stretched,

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.880
the tendon may be prone to

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.792
tear under the strain.

00:00:24.144 --> 00:00:26.384
When the Achilles tendon tears,

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.504
a pop may be felt or heard,

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.000
and is followed immediately by pain,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.408
and later by tenderness, swelling, and stiffness.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.448
It will become difficult or painful to walk,

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.552
or simply point your foot.
