00:00:00.304 --> 00:00:03.840
Laryngopharyngeal reflux, known as LPR,

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.664
is referred to as silent reflux.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.888
That’s because you may not experience

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.448
the burning associated with

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.848
gastroesophageal reflux disease,

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.928
referred to as acid reflux or GERD. 

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:18.264
In fact, you may not know you have a problem

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.488
until serious symptoms occur.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.200
LPR takes place when you lie down

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.232
and the acid in your stomach slowly

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.424
seeps up your esophagus.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.840
Typically, the upper and lower esophageal sphincters

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.152
prevents stomach acid from moving into the throat area.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.024
But if this sphincter doesn’t close correctly,

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.320
the acid will touch the back of the throat

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.816
and burn the tongue, the uvula and mouth area.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.632
This condition can also cause inflammation

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.432
or damage to the vocal cords

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.008
and rot your teeth.

00:00:50.496 --> 00:00:52.920
Symptoms of LPR include:

00:00:52.952 --> 00:00:54.592
Chronic sore throat

00:00:54.728 --> 00:00:55.808
Hoarseness

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.240
Lump in throat

00:00:57.344 --> 00:00:59.560
Constant need to clear throat

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.104
Postnasal drip

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.648
Trouble swallowing

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.464
Persistent cough

00:01:04.832 --> 00:01:07.448
If any of these symptoms last more than a month,

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.952
you may have silent reflux.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.088
In most cases, the condition can be treated by:

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.504
Elevating the head while sleeping

00:01:15.712 --> 00:01:18.088
Reducing alcohol consumption

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.992
Avoiding late night eating and overeating

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.448
Losing weight

00:01:22.608 --> 00:01:26.112
Taking antacids to avoid excess stomach acid

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.048
Surgery, when the condition is chronic
