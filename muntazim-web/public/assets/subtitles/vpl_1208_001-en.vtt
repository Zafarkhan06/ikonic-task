00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.120
You have been told that you need heart surgery.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.640
This information is to help prepare you for the surgery

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.220
and help you make lifestyle changes to improve your health

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:19.360
It is not intended to replace medical advice

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.040
and any information or instruction you receive from your physician.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.500
Your surgeon has discussed with you and your family

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.900
the surgical procedure you will need.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.040
Risks and complications

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.100
are dependent on many factors

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.820
and your doctor will discuss these with you before surgery.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.080
By signing the consent forms

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.220
you are consenting to the procedure

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.300
including the possible risks and complications.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.140
Therefore, it is important to have your personal affairs in order

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.980
and advanced directives.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.340
In the event you do have an unexpected complication

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.140
or prolonged hospital stay.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.660
If you are taking blood thinning medicines,

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.840
they may need to be stopped before surgery.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.660
Low doses of aspirin are not usually stopped.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.600
Ask your surgeon if you should take

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.360
your current medicines before arrival.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.480
If you smoke,

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.440
You should try very hard to quit before surgery.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.740
Stop taking herbal supplements

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.740
and over-the-counter medications

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.340
unless they are approved by your surgeon.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.780
Discharge planning begins before you were admitted.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.320
Plan to have someone with you for the first week at home.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.160
A visiting nurse may be ordered to check on you

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.400
to assess your lungs, incision, blood pressure and oxygen levels.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.400
If physical therapy or more extensive assistance is needed

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.280
A rehabilitation facility

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.800
or skilled nursing facility may be needed.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.340
Some of these tests will be done before surgery:

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.660
blood work

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.080
blood typing

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.560
You will not be allowed to donate your own blood

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.560
before surgery.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.400
Because of the danger of being anemic going into surgery.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.020
chest x-ray

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.880
carotid ultrasound to assess blood flow in the carotid arteries.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.760
Ultrasound of leg or arms to evaluate blood vessels.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.540
electrocardiogram (EKG)

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.400
Pulmonary function tests, to test the condition of the lungs.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.120
You will arrive at the hospital at the designated time.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.120
Usually two hours prior to surgery.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.460
intravenous lines for medicine

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.000
or blood transfusions are started.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.200
After you are given anesthesia in the operating room,

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.900
an arterial line to monitor blood pressure and draw blood samples

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.000
and a large intravenous line in your neck will be placed.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.520
A catheter will also be placed in your bladder.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.020
There is a specialized team of nurses,

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.760
anesthesiologists, perfusionists,

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.860
and technicians that will be caring for you.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.320
heart surgery requires an incision made vertically

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.140
down the center of your chest and the breast bone.

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.860
To allow the surgeon to reach your heart.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.080
A heart-lung machine is necessary for heart surgery.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.540
The heart-lung machine or cardiopulmonary bypass machine,

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.100
takes over the function of the heart and lungs

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.920
while the heart is at rest.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.580
Blood flows from the heart to the machine

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.340
where oxygen is added

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.260
and then the blood is pumped back to the body.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.200
When the surgery is finished,

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.160
the heart-lung machine support is gradually

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.800
reduced as your heart takes over the pumping of blood.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.940
Your family will wait for you in a special waiting room

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.440
during the surgery.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.040
Nurses will communicate with your family

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.500
and keep them informed about how you are doing.

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.800
After surgery you will go to the intensive care unit.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.700
You will have a breathing tube

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.460
which will be taken out as early as possible

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.760
and usually within a few hours after surgery.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.280
A nurse is always near you during this time.

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.820
You will have drainage tubes in the chest

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.780
to drain blood and fluids.

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.900
IVs, temporary pacemaker wires,

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.880
a tube to drain your stomach

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.180
and a catheter in your bladder.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.520
Your blood pressure and heart rhythm will be continuously monitored.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.920
When you are ready

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.100
you will be transferred out of ICU.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.460
Breathing exercises and walking

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.820
to prevent complications such as pneumonia and blood clots

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.660
are very important at this time.

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.680
The sternum (breast bone)

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.240
is closed using wires and requires several weeks to heal.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.660
You will be taught how to avoid lifting

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.680
and pulling with your arms during this time.

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.040
You will be ready for discharge 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.060
when your blood pressure and heart rhythm are stable,

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.920
you can get out of bed with minimal assistance, 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.780
oxygen needs are low,

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.780
there are no signs of infection,

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.780
and bowel function has returned.

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.660
Home care visits are arranged

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:22.820
for most patients to minimize problems

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.180
during this transition to home.

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.960
Some patients cannot discharge to home

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.320
and need more assistance to gain strength

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.800
and be able to care for themselves.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.700
Our team will recommend the most

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.280
optimal discharge plan for you.

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:46.180
Recovery from heart surgery is your responsibility.

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:50.200
Recovery can be a challenge for the patient and family.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.800
It can also be rewarding 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.140
giving one a new lease on life.

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:57.040
It is your responsibility to take control

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.240
and initiate lifestyle changes

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.700
that will maintain health.
