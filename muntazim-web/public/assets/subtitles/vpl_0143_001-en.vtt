00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.640
A column of bones called

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:03.656
vertebrae make up your spine.

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:05.304
The spinal cord passes

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.448
through the center of the column.

00:00:07.976 --> 00:00:09.376
The bones, or vertebrae,

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.128
that make up the spinal column

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.768
are not stacked directly

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.240
on top of each other.

00:00:14.552 --> 00:00:16.312
There are spaces between them

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:17.976
that are maintained by round,

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.512
spongy pads of cartilage

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:21.824
called intervertebral disks.

00:00:22.632 --> 00:00:24.672
Each intervertebral disk

00:00:24.672 --> 00:00:26.670
is made up of two components,

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.464
the anulus fibrosus

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.616
and the nucleus pulposus.

00:00:30.976 --> 00:00:33.424
The anulus fibrosus is the tough,

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.200
outer portion of the disk.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.928
The nucleus pulposus

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.632
is the inner gel material

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.304
surrounded by the anulus fibrosus.

00:00:41.656 --> 00:00:43.416
These disks and the space

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.384
between the bone that they fill,

00:00:45.504 --> 00:00:48.120
give the back flexibility.

00:00:48.776 --> 00:00:51.448
The disks act much like shock absorbers

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.912
throughout the spinal column

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.512
to cushion the bones as the body moves.
