00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.544
Acting like a pump,

00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:03.288
the human heart is a muscle that

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:04.992
contracts and relaxes

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:06.440
each time it beats.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.152
There are four heart compartments,

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.360
or chambers.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.384
The upper two are the atria,

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.704
and the lower two are the ventricles.

00:00:13.928 --> 00:00:15.632
Blood comes into the chambers

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.048
and is then pumped to the rest

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.224
of the body to supply nourishment.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.520
The flow of blood inside the heart

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.312
is controlled by four thin,

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.208
flexible valves that open

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.032
and close with each heartbeat.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.200
They are the tricuspid valve,

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.656
the pulmonic valve,

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.000
the mitral valve,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.704
and the aortic valve.

00:00:34.248 --> 00:00:36.400
The aortic valve is composed of

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.712
3 tissue flaps, called leaflets.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.144
It is located between the

00:00:40.144 --> 00:00:42.140
left ventricle and the aorta,

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.456
the blood vessel that carries

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.248
blood to the rest of the body.

00:00:45.528 --> 00:00:48.024
The aortic valve opens to move blood

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.808
from the heart into the aorta

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.368
and normally closes tightly

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.640
between each  heartbeat,

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.080
to keep the blood from flowing

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.608
back into the heart.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.264
Aortic valve regurgitation means

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.328
the valve does not close completely

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.528
between heartbeats,

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.976
and blood from the aorta

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.232
can move backward into the heart.
