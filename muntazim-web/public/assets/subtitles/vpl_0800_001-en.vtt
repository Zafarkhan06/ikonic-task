00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.352
Gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD,

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:05.328
is a digestive condition that affects

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:06.688
a muscle between the end of

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.344
your esophagus and stomach. 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.744
If you have GERD, this muscle, 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.880
called the lower esophageal sphincter,

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.472
or LES, doesn’t close like it should

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.296
and allows stomach acid to leak

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:18.904
back into your esophagus.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.280
This causes symptoms like

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.896
heartburn, chest pain, and nausea.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.352
Anti-reflux surgery is used to treat

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.608
GERD when medicines aren’t

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.776
successful in relieving symptoms.

00:00:29.384 --> 00:00:31.496
The goal of anti-reflux surgery

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.272
is to restore the normal function

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.272
of the lower esophageal sphincter.

00:00:35.464 --> 00:00:38.208
Before surgery, follow your doctor’s directions

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.736
for eating, drinking and taking medicine.

00:00:40.952 --> 00:00:43.808
During surgery, you will have general anesthesia,

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.608
so you will be asleep, and pain-free.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.256
Your surgeon will wrap the

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.712
top portion of your stomach

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.200
around the lowest part of your esophagus

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.496
and stitch it in place.

00:00:53.696 --> 00:00:56.184
This tightens the end of the esophagus,

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.984
and helps prevent stomach acid

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.664
from leaking back into it.

00:01:00.048 --> 00:01:01.920
After surgery, you will stay in a

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.320
recovery room until you are fully awake.

00:01:04.496 --> 00:01:06.320
Talk with your doctor to determine

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.448
whether surgery is a good option for you.
