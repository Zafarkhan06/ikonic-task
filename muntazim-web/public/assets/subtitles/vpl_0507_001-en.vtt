00:00:00.248 --> 00:00:01.808
Blood travels from your heart

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.120
to the rest of your body through arteries

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.408
to deliver oxygen and nutrients

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.432
before returning to the heart and lungs

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.152
through veins to pick up more oxygen.

00:00:11.568 --> 00:00:13.848
Veins in the legs and lower body

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.048
work against the force of gravity

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.136
to return blood to the heart.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.664
The walls of the veins contain valves

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.264
to prevent backflow.

00:00:22.376 --> 00:00:24.440
Muscles in the legs contract

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.208
to squeeze the veins and pump

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.664
the blood upward.

00:00:27.832 --> 00:00:30.064
Varicose veins are large,

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.200
ropey veins in the legs.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.272
They are always expanded because

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.000
the vein is having trouble bringing

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.728
blood back to the heart.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.656
The veins usually begin to get bigger

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.328
because pressure from gravity

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.752
pushes down on the column of blood,

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.616
and the thin-walled veins are pushed outward,

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.056
making them bigger.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.280
Varicose veins are bigger

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.856
and contain more blood,

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.224
which puts more pressure on the valves

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.152
which causes them to fail.

00:00:57.336 --> 00:01:00.560
Varicose veins are more common in older people,

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.232
because of changes in aging veins.

00:01:03.376 --> 00:01:05.480
Veins become less elastic,

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.800
so when stretched,

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.264
they don’t return to their previous shape.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.928
Valves in older veins weaken or won’t close,

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.504
so blood flows backwards and collects in pools.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.680
They appear blue because they’re carrying

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.552
blood that is returning to the lungs

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.192
that lacks oxygen.
