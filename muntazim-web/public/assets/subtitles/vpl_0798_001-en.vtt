00:00:00.272 --> 00:00:02.832
Neutropenia is the medical term used

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:04.232
when you have a low level of

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.048
white blood cells called neutrophils.

00:00:07.184 --> 00:00:09.544
These infection fighting white blood cells

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.056
are an important part of the immune system.

00:00:12.192 --> 00:00:13.720
Like other blood cells,

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.272
neutrophils are produced in the spongy tissue

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.808
inside of bones called marrow.

00:00:18.976 --> 00:00:21.096
Neutrophils are present in your bloodstream

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.488
to help defend your body against infection

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.872
by attacking harmful organisms, like bacteria.

00:00:28.936 --> 00:00:31.240
There are many causes of neutropenia.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.312
One such cause is treatment with chemotherapy.

00:00:34.416 --> 00:00:36.584
Patients living with cancer are frequently

00:00:36.584 --> 00:00:38.580
treated with chemotherapy drugs,

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.240
which may reduce the production of blood cells

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.432
including white blood cells.

00:00:43.928 --> 00:00:45.576
If you develop neutropenia

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.376
while receiving chemotherapy,

00:00:47.456 --> 00:00:49.944
it can mean that your immune system is weakened.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.280
This may increase your risk of infection,

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.072
or make it harder to fight an existing infection.

00:00:55.208 --> 00:00:58.016
If you're a cancer patient receiving chemotherapy

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.168
it's important to watch for signs of an infection.

00:01:01.272 --> 00:01:02.720
These include fever,

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:03.736
chills,

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.568
feeling generally unwell,

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.096
and redness or swelling in any area,

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.120
Especially around surgical wounds

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.664
and injection sites.

00:01:11.776 --> 00:01:14.560
Sometimes these infections can be dangerous

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.560
or even life threatening.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.440
If an infection is serious,

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.800
you may also need to be hospitalized

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.568
and your cancer treatment may need to be put on hold

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.512
while you are treated for your infection

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.784
and possible related side effects.

00:01:27.904 --> 00:01:29.824
There are a number of ways you can reduce

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.256
your risk of infection.

00:01:31.432 --> 00:01:33.488
Speak to your doctor or nurse

00:01:33.512 --> 00:01:35.232
to understand what you can do.
