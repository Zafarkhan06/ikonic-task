00:00:00.472 --> 00:00:02.160
Vision in older adults

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.384
may be impaired by

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:05.792
age-related macular degeneration,

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.160
or AMD.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:08.856
This painless disease

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:10.328
damages the macula,

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.056
which is in the center of the retina,

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:13.976
in the back part of the eye.

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.600
The macula helps you see fine details

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.264
in the center of your vision.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.320
AMD takes two forms:

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.896
wet and dry.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.872
Both result in a blind spot

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:25.496
around the center of vision

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.160
that makes it difficult to read,

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.608
drive, and recognize faces.
