00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.432
Your digestive tract is made up of

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:04.296
different organs and segments,

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:05.992
which develop from what is called the

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:07.112
“primitive gut”

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:08.408
in an embryo.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.808
The top part or foregut

00:00:10.808 --> 00:00:12.800
develops into esophagus,

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.520
stomach, and duodenum,

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.144
which is the first part of the small intestine.

00:00:17.312 --> 00:00:19.720
The middle part or midgut

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.512
develops into your jejunum and ileum,

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.040
the middle and lower parts

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.608
of your small intestine.

00:00:25.888 --> 00:00:28.208
The bottom section or hindgut

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.128
develops into your colon.

00:00:30.504 --> 00:00:32.792
Duodenum malrotation

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.240
is a congenital or birth defect,

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.496
in which the duodenum is twisted

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.936
or coiled on one side of your body.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.048
This can cause partial or complete

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.840
duodenal obstruction,

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.904
where stomach contents can’t pass

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.448
to the next part of the small intestine.

00:00:48.552 --> 00:00:50.936
This problem is treated with surgery.
