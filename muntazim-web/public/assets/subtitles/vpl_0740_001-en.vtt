00:00:00.256 --> 00:00:02.504
Your arteries are the blood vessels

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.664
that carry blood away from your heart,

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.064
to distribute oxygen

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.288
and nutrients throughout your body.

00:00:08.456 --> 00:00:10.856
An aneurysm is localized,

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:12.968
abnormal ballooning of an artery

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.560
due to weakness in the artery wall.

00:00:15.928 --> 00:00:17.600
An aneurysm that occurs

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.168
in an artery of the brain

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.528
is called a cerebral aneurysm.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.064
You can be born with it

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.656
or it can occur later in life.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.784
Your brain gets blood via a circle of

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.048
arteries at the base of the brain.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.896
Cerebral aneurysms usually occur

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.992
at the point where a cerebral artery

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.576
leaves this circle of arteries. 

00:00:39.232 --> 00:00:41.272
A cerebral aneurysm,

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.960
also known as a saccular aneurysm,

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.000
is a rounded sac of blood

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.768
bulging from the wall of an artery. 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.240
Some cerebral aneurysms,

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.160
particularly small ones,

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.176
may cause no symptoms or problems.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.416
But all cerebral aneurysms

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.144
have the potential to rupture or burst

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.480
and cause bleeding into the brain.
