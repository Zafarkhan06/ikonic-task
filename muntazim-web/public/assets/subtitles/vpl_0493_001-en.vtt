00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280
Diastasis recti means separation of the

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.592
paired rectus abdominus muscles,

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:07.168
which run lengthwise down the

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.632
front of your abdomen.

00:00:08.912 --> 00:00:10.984
This can occur during pregnancy,

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.584
when the muscles stretch to

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.792
accommodate the developing baby.

00:00:15.032 --> 00:00:17.456
The connective tissue between the muscles

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.032
stretches and thins

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:21.176
as the enlarged uterus distends

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.000
the belly wall outward.

00:00:23.176 --> 00:00:25.888
After delivery, abdominal fat can press

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.184
outward because the muscles

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.008
are still lax and weak.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.576
This creates a so-called

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.560
“pooch” in the lower abdomen.
