00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.540
HIV or human immunodeficiency viruses is the cause of AIDS.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.320
It can infect the bloodstream

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.400
following unprotected sex with an infected person,

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.400
exposure to infected blood,

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.240
or can be passed from an infected pregnant mother to her child.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.020
Having unprotected sex or sharing drug injection equipment

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.400
with a person infected with HIV

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.980
are the two most common ways to become infected.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.400
Once infected, the HIV virus attacks

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.320
and destroys the infection fighting CD4 cells

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.320
of the body's immune system.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.740
The loss of the immune system leaves patients

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.480
vulnerable to illnesses,

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.680
Including cancer, opportunistic infections and dementia.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.460
There is no cure for HIV AIDS

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.780
but there are treatments that slow the progression of AIDS

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.380
by limiting the number of immune cells that are destroyed.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.620
The body can then replace the ones that are lost.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.900
There are combinations of drugs used to treat HIV

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.860
called cocktails or triple therapy.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.340
These cocktails attack HIV in different ways

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.240
and protect the immune system

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.320
so it can continue to fight infections.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.080
One part of the cocktail or triple therapy

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.520
is called a protease inhibitor.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.700
A chemical called protease

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.280
is used to clip the HIV protein

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.180
into strands that contain a new virus,

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.120
which are then released into the body to do more damage.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.720
Protease inhibitors stop this step

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.560
and prevent the manufacture and release of new viruses.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.300
Protease inhibitors are the part of the HIV cocktail

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.540
that prevents HIV from sending out new HIV cells.
