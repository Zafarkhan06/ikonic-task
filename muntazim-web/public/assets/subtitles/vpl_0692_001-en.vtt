00:00:00.384 --> 00:00:02.248
One of the possible symptoms of

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.648
lung cancer is shortness of breath.

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.056
When you inhale,

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:08.464
the air moves down your main airway,

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.984
called your trachea.

00:00:10.168 --> 00:00:12.888
The air then moves into smaller airways

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.920
that branch into your lungs. 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.816
These smaller airways end in flexible

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.072
elastic sacs that expand and contract

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.784
as you breathe in and out,

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.392
filling and emptying your lungs.

00:00:25.544 --> 00:00:28.080
Cancer is caused by cells that multiply

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.352
faster than normal and, unlike normal cells,

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.744
cancer cells donâ€™t die.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.912
 All these cells growing together

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.432
in one spot forms a mass or tumor.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.112
If not caught early,

00:00:41.152 --> 00:00:43.528
a mass in your lungs can grow large enough

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.992
to block flow of air

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.872
in and out of the airways and sacs.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.600
Eventually, the area that cannot receive

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.448
air may collapse.
