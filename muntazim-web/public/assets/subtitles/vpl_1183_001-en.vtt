00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.160
Myocarditis occurs when the heart muscle becomes inflamed.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.520
Inflammation is a response by your body’s

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.580
immune system to fight off disease.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.820
But if an infection reaches the heart,

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.400
these disease-fighting cells enter the heart

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.880
causing inflammation and as a result,

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.180
the heart can become thick, swollen and weak.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.740
Most of the time Myocarditis is caused

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.540
by a virus that reaches the heart.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.520
It may also be caused by bacterial infections

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.860
or as a reaction to certain medicines.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.720
Some people in the early stage of Myocarditis

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:38.800
don’t have symptoms,

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.620
while others have symptoms that often

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.080
mimic the flu or that of a heart attack.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.700
Common symptoms include:

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.620
Chest pain

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:46.660
Fatigue

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.860
Rapid or irregular heartbeat

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.940
Shortness of breath, at rest or during activity

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.400
Headache, body aches, fever or sore throat

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.140
Joint pain or swelling

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.260
If you are having unexplained chest pain

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.520
and shortness of breath,

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.580
seek emergency medical help right away.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:04.760
Treatment is aimed at

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.520
the cause of the problem, and may involve:

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.300
Antibiotics to fight bacterial infections

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.360
Diuretics to remove excess water from the body

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.900
Beta blockers to improve arrhythmia

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.360
Medicine to help the body fight infection,

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.640
and to control inflammation

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.800
Depending on the cause of the problem and overall health.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.220
Some people may recover completely,

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.000
while others may have lasting heart complications.
