00:00:00.192 --> 00:00:02.928
Using a spray cleaner at least once a week

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.880
can increase your chances of having

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.760
asthma-like symptoms.

00:00:06.832 --> 00:00:10.120
Any aerosol-based product, like an oven cleaner,

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.000
increases the amount of chemicals in the air.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.600
Putting your head in the oven

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.584
and over-spraying increase your exposure.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.816
Breathing in the product can cause your

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.512
airways to become irritated and swollen,

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.072
and potentially to spasm, and narrow.

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.112
These changes can make it difficult to breathe.

00:00:28.248 --> 00:00:30.888
To reduce the risk of breathing in fumes,

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.704
always wear a face mask when using this type of product.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.856
Or switch to a liquid oven cleaner

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.096
that you apply with gloves and a rag,

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.680
which will not get into your lungs

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.680
the way an aerosol cleaner can.
