00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:05.280
Serotonin and norepinephrine are chemical messengers used

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.500
by nerve cells to communicate.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.040
Although the exact effect of these chemicals

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.800
on brain function isn't fully understood,

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.380
they are involved in controlling pain,

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.800
pleasure, anxiety, sleep and emotional behaviors.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.100
Serotonin and norepinephrine pass from cell to cell

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.240
by binding to receptors on nearby cells

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.120
to deliver messages.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.360
Nerve cells control the amount of serotonin and norepinephrine

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.720
traveling between the cells.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.840
They are recycled by cells

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.820
in a process called reuptake.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.300
Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors or SNRIs,

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.160
effect serotonin levels used to communicate

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.800
between nerve cells.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.840
By preventing the cells from recycling serotonin and norepinephrine

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.340
allowing them more time to relay the message.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.520
Changing the balance of serotonin in the brain

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.780
seems to help nerve cells send and receive

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.400
chemical messages, which in turn

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.520
boosts mood and reduces anxiety.
