00:00:00.288 --> 00:00:02.064
During development of a fetus,

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:03.512
tissues in the lip or palate

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.088
may not come together properly,

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.672
resulting in a cleft.

00:00:07.032 --> 00:00:08.936
A cleft lip means the upper lip

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:10.176
is open on one

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.464
or both sides. 

00:00:11.704 --> 00:00:14.152
A cleft lip can be surgically repaired.

00:00:14.264 --> 00:00:15.992
A cut is made on both sides

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.432
of the cleft from the mouth

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.680
into the nostril.

00:00:19.008 --> 00:00:20.520
The dark pink outer part

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.240
of the cleft is turned down,

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.032
and the muscle and skin of the lip

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:25.288
are pulled together.

00:00:25.736 --> 00:00:27.576
A cleft palate means the roof

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.200
of the mouth or palate

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.064
has an opening in the soft part

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.784
at the back or forward

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.224
toward the bony part.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.640
Surgical repair of a cleft palate

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.144
involves making a cut on

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.656
both sides of the separation

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.072
in the roof of the mouth.

00:00:41.488 --> 00:00:43.600
Tissue from each side is then moved

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.464
to the center and joined.

00:00:45.816 --> 00:00:47.656
The nostrils may also be repaired

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:48.912
during this surgery or

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.528
at another operation.

00:00:51.032 --> 00:00:52.904
These surgeries are usually done

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.928
in infants or toddlers.
