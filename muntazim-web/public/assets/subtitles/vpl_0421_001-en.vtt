00:00:00.728 --> 00:00:02.944
Aortic valve replacement.

00:00:08.648 --> 00:00:09.848
When damaged,

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.928
the aortic valve usually cannot

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.352
be repaired and must be replaced.

00:00:16.648 --> 00:00:18.688
Aortic valve replacement is done

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.176
with either a tissue

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:21.816
or a mechanical valve,

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.328
depending on your age,

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.472
your disease,

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:25.768
and your willingness to take

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.976
anticoagulation medicines.

00:00:31.336 --> 00:00:33.592
Tissue valves come from a pig,

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.712
from a cow, or from a human.

00:00:36.176 --> 00:00:37.848
These valves are very similar

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.280
to your own valve and

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.544
because your own body accepts them well,

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.224
you will not require long term

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.928
blood-thinning medication.

00:00:45.544 --> 00:00:48.072
The disadvantage of tissue valves, however,

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.568
is that they are less durable

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.192
than either our own valves

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.944
or mechanical valves.

00:00:55.016 --> 00:00:57.168
Mechanical valves are more durable

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.488
but are not natural,

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.976
and they may cause blood clots to form.

00:01:01.248 --> 00:01:03.048
Because of that possibility,

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.088
people who have mechanical valves

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.920
require blood-thinning medication

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.200
for the rest of their lives

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.120
to prevent blood clots.
