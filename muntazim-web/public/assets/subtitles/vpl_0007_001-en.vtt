Botox is the trade name of a purified form of the toxin

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.140
produced by the Clostridium botulinum bacteria.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.430
When a small amount of botox is injected into a muscle,

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.220
it blocks nerve signals that tell your muscles to contract.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.750
The effect is that it can temporarily smooth out facial wrinkles,

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.360
caused by muscle movement, such as forehead lines.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.220
