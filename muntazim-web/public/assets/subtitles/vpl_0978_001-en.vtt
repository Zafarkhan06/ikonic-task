00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.420
Biguanides help the body manage glucose and insulin more effectively.

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.080
They decrease glucose production in the liver

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.580
and the absorption of glucose from food.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.440
They also improve the cell's ability to recognize insulin

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.700
and increase the amount of glucose used for energy.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.340
Food comes into the body and is broken down into glucose

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.340
which trvels through the blood to be used as energy.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.660
The liver can also make glucose if the body needs it.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.900
When glucose enters the blood,

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.880
the pancreas releases the right amount of a hormone called insulin,

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.480
to balane the blood levels by delivering glucose into the cells

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.600
that need energy and storing the extra.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.420
Problems can occur when there is no insulin,

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.360
not enough insulin, or the cells can't recognize insulin

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.980
and can't use the glucose for energy.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.840
Biguanides makes insulin receptors more productive

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.060
by processing extra glucose

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.840
and making muscle tissue more capable of using insulin.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.920
This results in the body having an increased ability

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.760
to maintain healthy blood sugar levels.
