00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.460
Opioid Agonists can be used to alleviate pain

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:06.880
and in some cases treat addiction

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.760
resulting from the use of morphine, methadone,

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.400
heroin or other narcotic drugs.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.760
All of these drugs produce the same effect

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.300
as endorphins, naturally occurring compounds that

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.920
the body produces to mask pain

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.260
and create a pleasurable feeling.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.560
Opioid agonists are a class of medication

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.680
That provides the same effect as a

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.220
naturally occurring endorphin or opiate.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.000
Opioid agonists target the same pain receptors

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.260
as opiates in the brain and spinal cord.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.360
They bind to these receptors

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.480
and activate nerve pathways

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.320
in a way that mimics the effect

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.040
of an opiate drug.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.260
Depending on the drug and the dose,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.380
opioid agonists act on and excite these receptors

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.720
to produce results ranging from partial activation

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.620
to near total activation of the receptor.

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.160
The degree of activation effects

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.580
how the body experiences pain and pleasure.
