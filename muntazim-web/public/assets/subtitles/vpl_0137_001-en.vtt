00:00:00.304 --> 00:00:03.152
The prostate gland helps make semen

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.936
and is part of the male reproductive system.

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.040
It is below a manâ€™s bladder,

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.576
on top of the penis

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.280
and in front of the rectum.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.032
It surrounds the urethra,

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:14.896
which carries urine from the bladder

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:16.448
out through the penis.

00:00:16.648 --> 00:00:18.584
Prostate cancer occurs

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.320
because instead of growing and

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.168
dying in a normal way,

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.480
abnormal gland cells divide

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.392
and grow uncontrollably

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.928
and donâ€™t die.

00:00:28.112 --> 00:00:30.040
Cancer cells can spread from one

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.856
area or mass to surrounding tissue,

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.720
and travel through your bloodstream

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:35.864
or lymph system

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.744
to other parts of your body.

00:00:38.888 --> 00:00:40.944
Early prostate cancer often

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.512
causes no symptoms

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.136
and is diagnosed during routine screening

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.696
with a prostate-specific antigen test,

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.016
or PSA,

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.776
or during a digital rectal exam.

00:00:52.008 --> 00:00:53.560
If the tumor pushes on the

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.064
bladder or urethra,

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.568
it can cause problems with urination.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.800
Such symptoms are also common

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.776
with noncancerous conditions

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.984
such as an enlarged prostate.

00:01:04.312 --> 00:01:05.840
Other possible symptoms of

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.536
prostate cancer include

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.544
blood in the urine or semen,

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.344
erectile dysfunction,

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.264
and pain in the lower back,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.432
hips, or upper thighs.

00:01:15.744 --> 00:01:17.752
Treatment for prostate cancer depends

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.816
on many factors including

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.448
how fast it is growing,

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.904
whether it has spread,

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.832
your age, and potential side effects.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.720
Options include surgical removal of the gland,

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.568
called a prostatectomy;

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.184
radiation therapy;

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.640
hormone therapy;

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.432
and watchful waiting.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.664
Sometimes combination treatments are used.
