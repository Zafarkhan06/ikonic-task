00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.184
A column of bones called vertebrae

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:03.616
make up your spine.

00:00:03.712 --> 00:00:05.280
The spinal cord passes

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.320
through the center of the column.

00:00:07.528 --> 00:00:10.336
Small, circular cushions called disks

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.680
located between each vertebra

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.192
act as shock absorbers

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.536
when you move your back.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.320
Damage to a disk can cause the soft,

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.304
rubbery center to bulge out

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.920
of the hard, outer layer,

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.424
also called herniated disk.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.800
If it presses on nearby nerves,

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.056
a herniated disk

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.032
can cause severe pain.
