00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:04.368
Your pancreas is a long slender organ

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.808
that lies behind the stomach

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.240
and intestines, near the spine.

00:00:08.984 --> 00:00:10.824
This delicate but vital gland

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.920
is responsible for regulating your bodies

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.696
blood sugar with hormones such as insulin

00:00:17.104 --> 00:00:18.456
and for helping breakdown 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.808
food with digestive enzymes.

00:00:23.272 --> 00:00:26.088
The pancreas is divided into four parts:

00:00:26.248 --> 00:00:27.104
the head,

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.184
the neck,

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.176
the body,

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:30.440
and the tail.

00:00:32.552 --> 00:00:35.456
When cancer develops in the head of the pancreas,

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.568
surgeons often utilize the whipple procedure,

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.704
also known as a pancreatoduodenectomy,

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.112
to remove the cancerous and precancerous 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.336
tissue from the pancreas.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.152
Before beginning a whipple procedure,

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.328
a patient is put under general anesthesia.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.904
Your surgeon will then make 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.480
one or more incisions in the abdomen

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.616
depending upon the prefered approach,

00:00:58.792 --> 00:01:00.056
subcostal,

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.560
midline,

00:01:03.528 --> 00:01:05.864
or through several small incisions

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.080
known as a laparoscopic or

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.176
robot assisted approach.

00:01:10.752 --> 00:01:13.600
Your surgeon will remove the head of the pancreas

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.832
and a small segment of the intestine,

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.352
along with the gall bladder and common bile duct.

00:01:19.944 --> 00:01:22.480
A classic version of the whipple procedure

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.464
includes the removal of the lower end of the stomach

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.648
known as the pylorus.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.080
The pylorus is a valve that controls

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.232
the flow of food from the stomach to the intestines.

00:01:33.504 --> 00:01:36.024
This structure may be preserved when possible,

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.424
in a modification of the procedure known as

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.208
a pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.272
Especially large tumors may encroach

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.352
upon nearby critical blood vessels

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.048
that supply or drain the intestines.

00:01:50.304 --> 00:01:52.416
Reconstruction of the veins and arteries

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.456
involved is technically challenging,

00:01:54.456 --> 00:01:56.450
and is evaluated and performed

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.528
on a case by case basis.

00:01:59.104 --> 00:02:01.096
Once the mass has been removed,

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.040
your surgeon will begin reconstructing the digestive tract.

00:02:05.328 --> 00:02:07.680
A loop of small intestine will be connected

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.680
directly to the pancreas,

00:02:10.608 --> 00:02:12.560
the common hepatic duct,

00:02:13.584 --> 00:02:15.208
and then the stomach.

00:02:18.072 --> 00:02:20.352
The whipple procedure is very effective

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.136
at eliminating cancer and abnormal tissue growth

00:02:23.136 --> 00:02:25.130
within the head of the pancreas.

00:02:25.536 --> 00:02:27.040
It is a major operation

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.832
that usually takes up to 6 and often up to 8 hours.

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.024
Most patients are fully recovered and

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.016
back to daily life within a couple of weeks.
