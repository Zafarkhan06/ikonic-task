00:00:04.864 --> 00:00:07.856
Obesity is a serious health problem.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.560
Over 600 million people around the world

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:16.296
are obese, have a BMI of 30 or greater.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.336
obesity puts you at risk for a

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.208
multitude of health problems,

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.384
including diabetes, heart disease and even cancer.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.080
Fortunately, obesity treatments have advanced

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.368
greatly in recent years.

00:00:31.024 --> 00:00:32.592
Your physician may use a 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.664
step-wise approach to treatment,

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.680
that is determined by your BMI

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.680
and weight loss goals.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.672
This approach might begin with the 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.704
simplest of treatments, lifestyle change.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.488
The second tier integrates medications

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.920
into the treatment plan.

00:00:48.128 --> 00:00:50.736
Endoscopic devices may be very effective

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.936
within the third tier of treatment.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.992
Finally, a surgical solution may be necessary

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.472
to treat more severe cases of obesity.

00:00:59.232 --> 00:01:01.192
These innovative treatment options

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.960
can be employed alone or in combination

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.032
to achieve a wide range of weight loss goals.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.648
The groups of treatment options can vary

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.888
greatly in the resulting weight loss.

00:01:12.192 --> 00:01:13.912
Your physician will tailor a plan

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.984
specifically for your needs.

00:01:16.424 --> 00:01:18.296
Lifestyle change can include

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.480
tools such as diet modification,

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.728
exercise,

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.752
counseling,

00:01:22.752 --> 00:01:24.750
learning appetite control,

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.760
or even mobile apps.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.744
Some of the most recent advances in weight loss

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.032
have been in the development of medications.

00:01:32.408 --> 00:01:34.352
New medications have proven to be

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.464
very effective in treating obesity.

00:01:36.824 --> 00:01:39.776
Your physician may prescribe a medication alone,

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.768
or in tandem with other treatment options.

00:01:43.328 --> 00:01:45.392
Endoscopic treatments such as

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.384
gastric balloons or sutured gastric reduction

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.440
have many advantages.

00:01:50.696 --> 00:01:53.032
Endoscopic treatments offer the benefits of

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.432
dramatic weight loss,

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.432
without the risks and recovery time of surgery.

00:01:58.184 --> 00:02:00.416
In more severe cases of obesity,

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.856
your physician may recommend surgery.

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.224
Surgery can alter the stomach volume

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.024
and the digestive path followed by food.

00:02:08.352 --> 00:02:10.888
Surgery is the most physically invasive

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.360
of the treatment options,

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.664
but can also result in substantial weight loss.

00:02:16.128 --> 00:02:19.488
Talk to your physician about obesity treatment options.

00:02:19.872 --> 00:02:22.440
Newly developed treatments can greatly help

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.872
to improve your health and quality of life.
