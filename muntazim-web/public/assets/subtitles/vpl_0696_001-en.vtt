00:00:00.536 --> 00:00:03.000
Gout is a form of arthritis.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.416
There are many different types of arthritis,

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:07.656
but all result in short-term or

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.728
ongoing inflammation of one or more joints,

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.184
often with pain or stiffness. 

00:00:13.296 --> 00:00:15.752
Gout causes sudden, severe pain,

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.720
tenderness, and redness in and around joints,

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.760
particularly toe joints.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.840
It is more common in men.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.448
Just as there are many types of arthritis,

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.208
there are many causes,

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.136
including infection, aging, injury, and autoimmune disease. 

00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:34.816
Gout results from problems with the breakdown

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.648
and elimination of a waste product

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.632
your body forms called uric acid. 

00:00:39.904 --> 00:00:42.096
Uric acid forms from the breakdown of

00:00:42.096 --> 00:00:44.090
chemicals called purines.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.336
Purines come from cells in your body

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.120
as they die and are replaced,

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.016
and from foods you eat.

00:00:50.208 --> 00:00:52.032
The last stage in the breakdown of

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.992
purines is uric acid.

00:00:54.272 --> 00:00:56.592
Normally, uric acid travels through your

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.144
bloodstream to your kidneys,

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.232
to be eliminated in your urine. 

00:01:00.352 --> 00:01:03.048
Sometimes, however, your body produces

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.656
too much uric acid,

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.616
or does not eliminate enough to keep

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.656
levels from building up in your blood.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.392
In some people, high blood levels of uric acid

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.744
can lead to formation of needle-like

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.672
sodium urate crystals in joints or soft tissue. 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.392
These sharp crystals can cause the symptoms of gout.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.720
Treatment for gout includes medications

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.376
to reduce inflammation

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.152
and lower high blood levels of uric acid.
