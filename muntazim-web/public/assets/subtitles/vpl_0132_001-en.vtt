00:00:00.272 --> 00:00:02.168
There are 8 bones in the wrist

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.400
and 2, the radius and ulna,

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.848
in the lower arm.

00:00:06.016 --> 00:00:08.280
If your child has a wrist fracture,

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.128
it means there is a crack or break

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.856
in one of the bones of the wrist

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.416
or in the ends of the forearm bones.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.240
The most common cause is a

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.816
fall or a direct blow to the wrist.

00:00:19.176 --> 00:00:21.184
If the fracture is at the growth plate

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.640
near the end of the bone,

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.368
bone growth can be affected

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.416
and may require special X-rays

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:27.824
or other tests.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.696
Young bones are more flexible

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:30.584
than an adult’s,

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.208
so a child’s bone may crack

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.552
or just buckle without a clear break

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.048
instead of snapping like a dry stick.

00:00:37.256 --> 00:00:38.824
Your child may wear a splint

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.520
until swelling is reduced,

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.984
and a cast for 4 to 8 weeks.

00:00:43.208 --> 00:00:45.200
Surgery may be required to straighten

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.056
a broken bone that is crooked.
