00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.128
The first trimester of pregnancy

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.984
is a miraculous time,

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.792
as a single cell develops

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.536
into an embryo and then a fetus.

00:00:09.688 --> 00:00:11.576
After conception occurs,

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.768
a single cell divides to form a

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.592
cluster of cells that travels to the uterus

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.736
and implants itself in the lining.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.432
This marks the beginning of

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.864
what is called the embryonic stage,

00:00:22.896 --> 00:00:24.632
which lasts through the eighth week

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.096
after conception, or tenth week of pregnancy.

00:00:28.464 --> 00:00:30.592
The astonishing process of human

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.208
development continues

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.184
as the rapidly dividing cells

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.752
within the sphere organize into a disc,

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.792
which folds into three layers.

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.440
Simultaneously, each layer will develop into many

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.808
tissues, organs, and structures,

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.704
while the surrounding environment will also change

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.296
to nourish, protect, and support this development.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.464
A groove forms down the center of the disk,

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.576
which now has a top and bottom,

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.944
front and back, and left and right side.

00:01:00.136 --> 00:01:02.400
This neural groove deepens

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.984
and then forms a tube,

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.136
which develops into the brain and spinal cord.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.728
An early circulatory system develops

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.936
from tubes on the left

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.808
and right side of the groove.

00:01:12.888 --> 00:01:16.200
The tubes merge, kink, and fuse together

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.288
to form the chambers of the heart,

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.120
which will begin to beat and pump blood.

00:01:21.568 --> 00:01:24.592
The central nervous system is also developing.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.344
The neural groove closes like a zipper,

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.032
forming a tube that becomes

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.232
the spinal cord and brain.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.032
The closing is faster toward the head end,

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.528
as the different parts of the brain develop.

00:01:36.712 --> 00:01:39.472
The ends of the groove then close.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.872
Other organs such as the liver begin to develop.

00:01:45.176 --> 00:01:47.448
Arm and leg buds appear.

00:01:49.168 --> 00:01:50.648
To support this growth,

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.464
nutrients come from the mother

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.696
through the placenta via the umbilical cord.

00:01:56.656 --> 00:01:59.256
The arms and legs continue to grow,

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.320
with paddle-like shapes where the hands and feet will be.

00:02:05.664 --> 00:02:08.136
The hands and feet continue to develop,

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.440
and soon the arm can bend at the elbows.

00:02:12.264 --> 00:02:14.320
Fingers and toes appear.

00:02:16.488 --> 00:02:18.640
Facial features start to appear

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.480
as the brain grows to support

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.440
the senses, such as vision and hearing.

00:02:23.784 --> 00:02:25.936
The intestines also develop,

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.488
first projecting into the umbilical cord

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.832
outside the body

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.312
and then inside the abdomen.

00:02:32.672 --> 00:02:35.416
Muscles and bones begin to develop.

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.296
The position of the limbs moves

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.352
from the center to the side,

00:02:39.384 --> 00:02:42.136
and the knees take shape in the legs.

00:02:42.944 --> 00:02:45.240
As development continues,

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.088
facial features become more refined.

00:02:49.296 --> 00:02:51.424
All the organs are developing. 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.864
Some, such as the liver and thyroid,

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.860
are already functioning.

00:02:57.712 --> 00:02:59.904
By the end of the first trimester,

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.304
the developing baby is a miniature person.
