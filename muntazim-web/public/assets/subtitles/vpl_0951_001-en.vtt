00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940
Macrolides are a group of antibiotics that are

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.420
highly effective in treating bacterial infections.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.720
Including pneumonia, bronchitis,

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.840
sinusitis, pelvic inflammatory disease,

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.260
urinary tract infections and skin infections.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.460
These drugs do not directly kill bacteria

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.400
but they prevent bacteria from reproducing and spreading.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.440
Macrolides work by stopping the bacteria

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.840
from making proteins

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.220
that are necessary for reproduction.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.660
Macrolides also tend to accumulate

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.020
in white blood cells called Leukocytes.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.840
Leukocytes are activated by the body's immune system,

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.020
and they travel to sites of infection

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.540
bringing the Macrolides with them.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.320
With Macrolides in the infection site

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.600
the bacteria cannot reproduce,

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.380
so they die or they are killed by the immune system.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.080
Macrolides also have anti-inflammatory qualities

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.840
that can help reduce symptoms related to certain

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.620
chronic pulmonary and respiratory conditions.
