00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.940
Opioids are a class of drugs that may be prescribed for severe pain

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.400
or after a medical or dental procedure.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.160
When your body experiences trauma,

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.960
nerve endings send signals through your spinal cord

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.240
to your brain which interprets the signal as pain.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.300
Opioid drugs bind to opioid receptors in your brain,

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.260
spinal cord, and other areas in your body.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.920
They reduce the pain signals to your brain

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.200
and block feelings of pain.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.240
While they can relieve pain,

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.780
opioids carry risks and can be highly addictive.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.200
Opioids trigger a release of dopamine,

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.380
a chemical in your brain that makes you feel calm, happy, and euphoric.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.580
These feelings are only temporary

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.880
and your brain tells you you need more,

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.700
or a higher dose, to produce the same effect each time.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.920
This is called tolerance.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.220
Opioids can make your brain and body dependent

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.280
encouraging you to take more

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.400
and at the same time

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.680
reducing your self-control and ability to stop.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.320
Additionally, if you suddenly stop taking opioids,

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.920
you can experience withdraw symptoms such as

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.440
jitters, insomnia, negative emotions,

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.500
and nausea or vomiting.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.080
This can lead to an addiction,

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.080
which anyone is at risk for.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.720
People who use opioids to control pain

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.880
should contact their health care professional

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.020
if they believe that they may be developing

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.720
a tolerance or addiction.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.860
If you are prescribed opioids,

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.000
take them only as long and as prescribed

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.160
by your health care professional.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.500
Side effects of opioids include:

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.300
Sleepiness, Constipation, Nausea, 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.300
A physical dependence.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.940
Opioids also can cause more serious side effects.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.040
The following might be symptoms of an

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.560
opioid overdose and should be reported immediately:

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.020
Shallow breathing,

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.580
Slowed heart rate,

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.920
Loss of consciousness.
