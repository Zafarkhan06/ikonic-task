00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.980
Cellulite is a condition that causes your skin

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.200
to look “bumpy” or “dimpled.”

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.200
It occurs more frequently in women

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.100
and often appears on your thighs,

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.300
hips, buttocks, and stomach.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.680
Cellulite is caused by fat

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.500
under the skin

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.300
and fibrous connective cords

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.820
that tether the skin to the underlying muscle.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.840
As fat cells increase and push against the skin,

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.220
the fibrous cords pull down 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.260
creating an uneven surface

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.920
or dimpling, known as cellulite.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.640
Cellulite often appears

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.000
no matter your body type

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.560
and is also more common with aging,

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.860
when the skin loses elasticity.
