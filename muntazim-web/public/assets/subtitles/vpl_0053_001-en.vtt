00:00:03.456 --> 00:00:06.000
Gastroesophageal reflux disease

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.216
or GERD,

00:00:07.552 --> 00:00:09.352
refers to chronic heartburn

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:11.368
that occurs at least twice a week.

00:00:12.208 --> 00:00:14.064
The pain of GERD results from

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:15.592
acid in stomach contents

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:17.576
flowing backward in the esophagus

00:00:17.824 --> 00:00:18.752
the tube connecting the

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:19.912
mouth and stomach.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.656
The acid irritates and burns

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.440
the lining of the esophagus.

00:00:24.976 --> 00:00:26.760
This backward flow of stomach acid

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.656
results from leakage of a valve

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.824
where the esophagus joins the stomach.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.232
As GERD progresses,

00:00:33.352 --> 00:00:34.728
the valve may be scarred

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.064
by acid exposure,

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.968
so that leakage increases,

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.288
and the esophagus is damaged further.
