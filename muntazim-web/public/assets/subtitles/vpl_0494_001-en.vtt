00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.328
A woman becomes pregnant

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.328
when one of her eggs is fertilized by sperm.

00:00:05.552 --> 00:00:08.416
Normally, once an egg has been fertilized,

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:10.512
it moves down a Fallopian tube

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:12.312
to the uterus or womb.

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.680
It implants itself in the uterine wall

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.680
and is now an embryo.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.992
In an ectopic pregnancy,

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.288
the fertilized egg implants itself

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.888
outside the uterus because damage,

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.816
scarring, or distortion of the Fallopian tubes

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.400
leaves it unable to pass

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.328
easily into the uterus.

00:00:30.848 --> 00:00:33.272
Implantation in a Fallopian tube

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.408
is called a tubal pregnancy.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.568
Or the egg may implant itself

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.152
in an ovary, the abdomen or the cervix.

00:00:41.528 --> 00:00:44.056
Whatever the site of implantation,

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.232
an ectopic pregnancy cannot

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.800
continue to birth.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.320
If the embryo continues to develop,

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.520
the tube or organ containing it,

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.216
will eventually burst

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.008
a potentially life-threatening emergency.

00:00:57.232 --> 00:00:59.480
The risk of an ectopic pregnancy is

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.848
increased by tube infections,

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.984
surgery inside the abdomen,

00:01:04.056 --> 00:01:07.224
fertility medications at the time of fertilization,

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.584
and a prior ectopic pregnancy.

00:01:09.768 --> 00:01:11.888
An ectopic pregnancy is usually

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.384
identified during the first

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.688
5 to 10 weeks of pregnancy.

00:01:15.784 --> 00:01:17.816
Causing symptoms of abdominal and

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.016
pelvic pain and vaginal bleeding,

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.672
it may be confused with a miscarriage.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.016
How the developing cells are removed

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.576
depends on their location and size.
