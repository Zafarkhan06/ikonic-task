00:00:00.448 --> 00:00:03.144
Hepatitis C is an infectious disease

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.688
caused by the Hepatitis C virus,

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.344
or HCV.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.664
It is spread through body fluids,

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.400
most commonly blood. 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.744
Once the virus enters the bloodstream,

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.344
it travels to the liver

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.464
and attaches to receptors on the surface

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.184
of liver cells called hepatocytes.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.304
The virus’s fatty or lipid coat

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.936
merges with the cell’s outer membrane,

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.808
so that the virus’s protein core is inside the cell.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.320
The coat on the core dissolves.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.128
This releases a strand of RNA,

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.176
which carries viral genetic information.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.280
The virus takes over components of

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.536
the cell called ribosomes,

00:00:42.608 --> 00:00:44.496
which produce an enzyme needed to

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.064
reproduce the viral RNA.

00:00:47.296 --> 00:00:49.176
When there is enough of this enzyme,

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.792
called RNA transcriptase,

00:00:51.944 --> 00:00:55.016
the viral RNA produces a copy of itself.

00:00:55.312 --> 00:00:57.784
This copy serves as a template,

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.792
which is copied many times as 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.752
the genetic material for new viruses.

00:01:03.056 --> 00:01:05.984
The viral RNA directs the ribosomes

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.920
to produce proteins that form

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.056
the virus’s protein coat.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.264
They assemble around the RNA

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.360
into new virus particles.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.768
The viruses travel to the membrane,

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.304
which circle and release it with a new lipid coat.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.048
This process continues until the cell dies.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.064
Over time millions of liver cells can be destroyed.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.320
The immune system also attacks

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.888
the infected cells.

00:01:32.144 --> 00:01:34.304
Both can damage the liver.

00:01:34.608 --> 00:01:37.224
About 75% of those infected

00:01:37.224 --> 00:01:39.220
develop chronic infection.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.000
At its mildest, there are no signs or symptoms.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.760
Serum enzymes—a blood test for liver disease

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.296
are normal, and liver biopsy shows only mild injury.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.240
Those with severe disease have symptoms,

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.336
high blood levels of HCV RNA,

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.552
elevated serum enzymes,

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.832
and significant liver damage.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.240
At least 20% develop cirrhosis. 

00:02:05.528 --> 00:02:07.792
Treatment options are available.

00:02:08.032 --> 00:02:10.416
