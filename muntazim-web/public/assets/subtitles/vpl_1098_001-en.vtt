00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.420
Coronary artery disease, or CAD,

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.840
is the narrowing or blockage of the coronary arteries,

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.900
the blood vessels that supply blood

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.940
and oxygen to your heart.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.020
This condition is often caused by atherosclerosis.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.760
Atherosclerosis is a buildup of thick,

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.580
fatty deposits, called plaque,

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.140
on the inside walls of your arteries.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.660
As plaque builds up,

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.820
blood flow through the artery is slowed or blocked.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.040
Reduced blow flow lessens the amount of oxygen

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.420
and other nutrients reaching the heart.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.760
If your coronary arteries are narrowed

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.680
you may have symptoms including,

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.680
Chest pain, known as angina

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.340
Shortness of breath

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.220
Weakness, light-headedness, and nausea

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.240
The plaque could also break off,

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.260
leading to a heart attack.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.040
Risk factors for developing

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.260
coronary artery disease include:

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.780
High blood pressure

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.500
High cholesterol

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.800
Smoking or tobacco use

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.380
Diabetes

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:06.960
Obesity

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.980
Or a family history of heart disease

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.440
Coronary artery disease usually

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.580
develops over many years.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.320
You may not notice a problem

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.420
until you have a serious blockage or a heart attack.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:20.680
Talk with your doctor

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.500
if you have risk factors for coronary disease.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.980
A healthy lifestyle can help prevent

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.300
and treat coronary artery disease.
