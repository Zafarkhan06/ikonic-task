Your eyes work a lot like a camera.

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:04.864
The lens of a camera focuses

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:06.992
light onto the film inside.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.408
The cornea and lens

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.728
in the front of the eye

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.608
focus light onto the back,

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.208
where light-sensitive tissue

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.288
called the retina is located.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.576
When the retina receives an image,

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.208
it sends a signal through the

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.800
optic nerve to the brain

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.768
for the image to be developed.
