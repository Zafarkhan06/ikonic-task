00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.140
Diverticulitis is an inflammation of diverticula,

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.380
or pockets that form in the lining of the intestine.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.320
These pockets can form anywhere in the large intestine,

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.560
but are most commonly found in the sigmoid colon.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.760
The presence of these tiny bulges or pockets in the colon

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.600
is a condition known as diverticulosis,

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.060
which on it’s own usually doesn’t cause

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.260
any symptoms or need to be treated.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.940
However, these pockets tend to get inflamed

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.300
or obstructed with stool or other foreign material.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.620
Once inflamed, it becomes the condition, diverticulitis.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.500
Diverticula form in weakened areas of your colon’s walls.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.980
As pressure builds inside the colon

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.920
the weak areas bulge and create pockets.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.200
These pockets are very common and increases with age.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.180
Diverticulosis occurs in 10%

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.880
of people over the age of 40

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.800
and 50% of people over age 60.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.520
And it affects almost everyone over age 80.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.820
Common symptoms of diverticulitis include:

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.320
Pain and tenderness in the left lower side of the abdomen

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.040
Nausea and vomiting

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.740
Fever and chills

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.080
The best way to prevent diverticulosis

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.020
and diverticulitis is to eat more fiber

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.800
and drink plenty of water.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.080
Avoid constipation and straining.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.020
Having regular bowel movements,

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.040
which are softer and move quickly

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.640
through the colon is important

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.620
for preventing diverticular disease.
