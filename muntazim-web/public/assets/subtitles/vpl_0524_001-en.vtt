00:00:00.296 --> 00:00:03.984
The medical name for bad breath is halitosis.

00:00:04.104 --> 00:00:06.000
Food particles breaking down

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.360
in and around your teeth

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.448
can give off a bad odor.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.408
Particles that remain due to

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.000
poor dental hygiene

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.144
can cause a build up of bacteria,

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:16.928
which release sulfur compounds

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.280
that make your breath smell bad.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.128
If not removed, bacteria that attach

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.728
themselves to tooth enamel

00:00:23.744 --> 00:00:26.344
can form a film called plaque.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.760
Plaque produces acid that eats away at tooth enamel;

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.824
causing the holes we call cavities.

00:00:33.176 --> 00:00:34.968
Sinus problems that lead to

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.880
increased production of mucus

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.048
provide a breeding ground for bacteria

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.824
that cause bad breath.

00:00:40.824 --> 00:00:42.820
Another cause of halitosis

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.344
is bacterial infection of the tonsils,

00:00:45.368 --> 00:00:47.136
known as tonsillitis.
