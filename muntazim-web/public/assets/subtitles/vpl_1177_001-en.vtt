Dermaplaning is a procedure that exfoliates your skin

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.320
by removing the top, dead skin cells

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.160
as well as “peach fuzz,”

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.700
the short, soft hairs on your face.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.020
It can help improve the appearance of wrinkles

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.940
and acne scars and may give skin

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.220
a smoother, brighter appearance.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.420
During a dermaplaning procedure

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.080
your provider will gently pull your skin tight

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.480
and, using a special razor or scalpel,

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.660
will shave away the top most layers of your skin.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.840
Your results depend on your skin type,

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.040
tone, and medical history.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.080
You provider can make a recommendation

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.320
based on your specific needs.
