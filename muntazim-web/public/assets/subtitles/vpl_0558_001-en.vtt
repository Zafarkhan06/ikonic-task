00:00:00.312 --> 00:00:03.048
One formula dentists use for cavities

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.016
is carbohydrates plus bacteria plus teeth.

00:00:07.208 --> 00:00:09.392
Your mouth is home to thousands of

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.552
bacteria of different types.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.392
Many are not harmful

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:16.240
but some can be highly destructive.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.168
One type that thrives in an oral environment

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.696
and is often present in large quantities

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.560
is the mutans streptococcus group.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.664
When you eat carbohydrates, so do they.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.536
And they metabolize carbs into acid,

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:31.904
which can strip minerals

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.864
from the toothâ€™s outer layer.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.024
Over time this process,

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.088
known as demineralization,

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.056
can extend through the enamel

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.200
into the dentin and then the core or pulp,

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.936
which contains nerves and blood vessels.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.544
Bacteria can then move in as well.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.248
When a bacterial infection at the center

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.976
causes pus to collect,

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.152
a person is said to have a tooth abscess.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.400
Sometimes the pulp dies.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.672
The infection can spread to the gums,

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.336
cheek, jaw, throat, and facial bones.
