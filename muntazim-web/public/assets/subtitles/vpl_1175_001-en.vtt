00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:03.280
Tips for better sleep

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.800
Many people regularly get poor sleep

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.860
and poor sleep has been shown to

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.480
negatively affect your hormones,

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.040
exercise performance, and brain function.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.240
Over time it can also cause weight gain

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.800
and increase disease risk

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.000
in both adults and children.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.800
A good night’s sleep is important

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.500
for your overall health.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.000
Follow these tips to encourage better sleep. 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.460
Follow a consistent sleep schedule 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.960
Try to get up at the same time every day,

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.420
even on weekends or during vacations.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.460
Set a bedtime that is early enough

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.600
for you to get at least 7-8 hours of sleep.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.560
Create a calm and relaxing environment.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.860
Keep your bedroom dark

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.340
and a comfortable, cool temperature. 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.980
Remove or limit light-emitting screens

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.800
such as TVs, computers, and

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.320
smart phones from the room.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.520
Establish a relaxing bedtime routine.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.040
Doing calming activities before bedtime,

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.140
such as listening to relaxing music,

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.420
reading a book, taking a hot bath,

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.520
meditating, deep breathing, and visualization

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.360
might promote better sleep.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.320
Pay attention to what you eat and drink

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.220
Don’t drink caffeine in the afternoon or evening.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.940
Avoid consuming alcohol before bedtime.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.040
Don’t eat a large meal within

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.740
a couple of hours of bedtime.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.540
If you are hungry at night,

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.540
eat a light, healthy snack.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.380
Reduce your fluid intake before bedtime.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.780
Get some exercise.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.820
Include regular physical activity

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:36.820
during the day.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.760
However, avoid being active 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.540
too close to bedtime.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.400
Limit daytime naps.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.920
A short power nap may be beneficial 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.220
but limit naps to an hour or less

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.500
and avoid napping late in the day. 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.600
Almost everyone has

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.280
an occasional sleepless night.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.700
However, if you’ve always struggled with sleep,

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.160
it’s a good idea to check in

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.320
with your healthcare provider 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.600
for any underlying conditions.
