00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.552
Acupuncture is an alternative form of

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.408
medicine that originated in China

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.688
more than 2,000 years ago.

00:00:06.768 --> 00:00:09.224
A practitioner inserts hair-thin,

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.048
but solid metallic needles

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.232
into the skin at special points along the body.

00:00:14.304 --> 00:00:16.128
Studies show that acupuncture

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.440
may reduce pain and nausea.

00:00:18.544 --> 00:00:20.272
Once an acupuncture needle

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.032
is inserted into the skin,

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.248
it remains in place and vibrates

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.384
slightly from side to side.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.976
This vibration energy resembles a radio wave.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.280
There is no conclusive explanation

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.064
for how acupuncture works

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.336
but it is believed that by placing needles

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.304
in strategic locations

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.384
essentially along 2,000 acupuncture points

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.752
located on different nerve channels

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.096
it is possible to inhibit the transmission of

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.384
pain along nerves to the brain. 

00:00:48.528 --> 00:00:50.424
Acupuncture is used to treat

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.016
an array of health and medical problems,

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.840
including back pain, PMS, migraines, osteoarthritis and cancer.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.408
It is also used to alleviate nausea

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.480
associated with chemotherapy.
