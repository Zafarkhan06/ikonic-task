00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.280
Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease that

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.180
is triggered when you get foods containing gluten.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.960
Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.620
Exposure to gluten creates an immune response

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.620
that attacks the small intestine.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.320
The attack leads to damage of the villi,

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.100
the small fingerlike projections

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.940
that line the small intestine.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.400
When your small intestineâ€™s villi are damaged,

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.460
your small intestine cannot properly

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.180
absorb nutrients from food.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.940
This can lead to malnourishment

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.800
and other serious health problems.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.480
Symptoms vary and can be different in children and adults.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.720
Common symptoms for children include:

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.060
Nausea and vomiting

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.360
Chronic diarrhea

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.260
Abdominal bloating and pain

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.580
Constipation

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.860
Pale, foul-smelling stool

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:51.980
Gas

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.740
Adults may experience digestive issues as well,

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.760
but most experience other symptoms including:

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.660
Iron-deficiency anemia

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:00.600
Fatigue

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.400
Headaches

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.040
Bone or joint pain

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.060
Arthritis

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.720
Osteoporosis

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.840
Nerve problems including tingling,

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.180
numbness or pain in the hands and feet

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.000
Sores inside the mouth

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.600
Itchy skin rash

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.580
For most people,

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.680
following a strict gluten-free diet

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.920
can help manage symptoms

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.120
and protect your small intestine.
