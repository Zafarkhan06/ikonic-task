00:00:00.856 --> 00:00:04.728
An upper endoscopy, sometimes called an EGD,

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.176
is a procedure your doctor may perform

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.992
to examine your upper digestive tract.

00:00:10.208 --> 00:00:13.048
Your doctor will look at the lining of your esophagus,

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.528
stomach and the beginning of your small intestine.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.672
An upper endoscopy helps your

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.568
doctor investigate digestion problems,

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.032
diagnose diseases,

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.344
and treat some conditions in your digestive system.

00:00:26.744 --> 00:00:28.592
To prepare for the procedure,

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.984
you will need to stop eating and drinking for

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.760
4 to 8 hours before the exam.

00:00:33.896 --> 00:00:35.752
You may need to stop taking certain

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.416
blood thinning medicines.

00:00:37.528 --> 00:00:39.728
Your doctor will give you instructions regarding

00:00:39.728 --> 00:00:41.720
all your current medicines. 

00:00:41.944 --> 00:00:43.416
To begin the procedure,

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.512
you will lie down comfortably on your left side.

00:00:46.656 --> 00:00:48.632
Your doctor may spray a solution

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.320
in your mouth to numb your throat

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.128
and give you a sedative to help you relax.

00:00:53.352 --> 00:00:55.632
Your doctor will pass a flexible tube,

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.000
called an endoscope,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.704
into your mouth and down your throat.

00:00:59.832 --> 00:01:01.656
A tiny light and camera at the

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.704
end of the tube allows your doctor

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.040
to see the inside of your esophagus,

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.488
stomach and the beginning of your small intestine.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.344
Your doctor may use air or water

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.056
passed through the endoscope

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.216
to clean or expand areas of

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.592
your digestive tract to make it easier to see.

00:01:19.736 --> 00:01:21.184
During the procedure,

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.176
small instruments can be passed

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.904
through the endoscope to collect

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.304
tissue samples, called a biopsy,

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.256
or to remove abnormal growths,

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.656
such as a polyp. 

00:01:30.944 --> 00:01:34.032
The procedure typically lasts 15 to 30 minutes

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.896
and is usually not painful,

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.528
but you may feel some slight pressure.

00:01:38.904 --> 00:01:40.192
After the procedure,

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.240
you will stay in a recovery room for

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.552
30 to 60 minutes while the sedative wears off.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.072
Plan to have someone drive you home.

00:01:48.296 --> 00:01:49.952
Your doctor will contact you with

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.888
the results of the endoscopy.
