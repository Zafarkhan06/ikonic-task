00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.112
Your circulatory system transports nutrients and oxygen

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.952
to billions of cells throughout your body.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.536
It is divided into 3 major parts:

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.888
your heart, blood, and blood vessels.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.208
Red blood cells carry oxygen from your lungs

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.192
to all your bodyâ€™s cells

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.576
and pick up carbon dioxide to be carried

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.088
back to the lungs and eliminated when you exhale.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.944
Blood is transported through blood vessels.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.608
Oxygen and nutrients pass from the blood

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.544
into cells through the walls

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.664
out of tiny vessels called capillaries.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.344
Angiogenesis is the process of

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.192
growing new blood vessels

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.696
from ones that have already formed.

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.896
It is important for both good health and healing.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.296
However, it can also support the growth of cancer cells. 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.768
Cells release chemical messengers,

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.312
which activate cells in blood vessels

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.136
to form new vessels that grow

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.424
towards the source of the signals. 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.160
Cancer cells grow uncontrollably

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.880
and do not die like normal cells.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.320
The oxygen and nutrients supplied

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.480
through new blood vessels support this growth.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.904
They also enable cancer cells to move

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.592
through the vessels to other parts of the body.
