00:00:00.296 --> 00:00:02.232
Fluids are essential for a

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:03.968
healthy functioning body.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.400
They enable an array of processes,

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.984
including bioelectrical and digestive functions.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.752
As water and other liquids

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.160
pass through the kidneys, they are processed

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.880
and waste is secreted with part of the water as urine.

00:00:18.056 --> 00:00:20.144
body uses urine as one of the

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.000
primary ways to eliminate waste.

00:00:23.424 --> 00:00:25.344
Urine receives its color

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.448
from the breakdown of red blood cells

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.880
and other substances

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.584
during normal cellular metabolism.

00:00:31.848 --> 00:00:35.752
This process produces molecules of urobilin.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.008
Your hydration level influences

00:00:38.008 --> 00:00:40.456
the volume and color of your urine.

00:00:40.632 --> 00:00:42.512
If you are well hydrated 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.616
your urine will appear clear.

00:00:44.808 --> 00:00:47.408
Certain other substances, including foods,

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.248
alcohol and B vitamins can also affect

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.920
the composition and color of your urine.

00:00:53.416 --> 00:00:55.096
If you are dehydrated,

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.032
your kidneys retain water

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.544
and you make less urine

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.656
and your urine takes on more of a yellow or brown color

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.872
due to higher concentrations of urobilin.

00:01:05.136 --> 00:01:07.552
If your urine takes on a red cast,

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.368
you should visit a doctor.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.760
It may be a sign of internal bleeding,

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.952
kidney disease or cancer.
