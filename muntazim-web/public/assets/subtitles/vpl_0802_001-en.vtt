00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.560
Varicose veins are enlarged, bumpy,

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.080
twisty veins visible through your skin.

00:00:09.416 --> 00:00:12.312
Varicose veins usually develop in your legs and feet

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.840
when the valves in your veins don't work like they should.

00:00:14.928 --> 00:00:16.480
This causes blood to flow

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:17.936
backward in your veins,

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:19.984
instead of going to your heart.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.456
Spider veins are like varicose veins 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:23.888
and are visible through the skin,

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.184
but are smaller twisted red, blue or purple vessels.

00:00:28.296 --> 00:00:30.864
Sclerotherapy is a procedure that causes

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.728
spider or varicose veins to disappear over time. 

00:00:33.856 --> 00:00:35.632
Before sclerotherapy, you may 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.456
need to avoid certain medicines.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.448
Talk with your doctor about all medicines

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.296
including over-the-counter drugs,

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.056
herbs, and dietary supplements

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.520
you are taking before the procedure.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.504
During sclerotherapy, a solution is injected

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.304
through a very fine needle directly into your vein. 

00:00:51.432 --> 00:00:53.960
The solution causes your vein to collapse,

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.120
shrink, and eventually disappear

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.216
as your body naturally absorbs it.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.872
Sclerotherapy is an outpaitent procedure

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.384
and usually takes 15 to 45 minutes,

00:01:03.432 --> 00:01:06.232
allowing you to return home on the same day. 

00:01:06.352 --> 00:01:09.416
Ask your doctor if sclerotherapy is right for you.
