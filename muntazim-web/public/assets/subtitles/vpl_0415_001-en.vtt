00:00:00.296 --> 00:00:02.784
Pneumonia means inflammation of

00:00:02.784 --> 00:00:04.780
the lungs due to infection,

00:00:04.856 --> 00:00:07.184
most commonly a viral infection,

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.200
such as a cold or flu.

00:00:09.432 --> 00:00:11.552
Bacteria, fungi,

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:12.960
or other organisms

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.144
can also cause pneumonia.

00:00:15.352 --> 00:00:17.880
Risk increases with old age,

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.880
youth, or a suppressed immune system.

00:00:21.072 --> 00:00:23.336
Hospitalized patients also have an

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.000
increased risk of pneumonia

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.864
that can be difficult to treat

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.032
and is a growing concern.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.792
Symptoms of pneumonia vary:

00:00:31.936 --> 00:00:33.704
sudden chest pain,

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.736
fever,

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:35.952
chills,

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:36.664
cough,

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.344
and shortness of breath.

00:00:39.008 --> 00:00:41.032
Pneumonia kills thousands of

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.184
people each year,

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.032
particularly children.

00:00:44.296 --> 00:00:46.600
Treatment depends on the cause:

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.512
antibiotics for bacterial infection,

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.184
over-the-counter medications

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.264
for symptoms of viral infections,

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.080
such as cold and flu,

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.080
and anti-fungal medications

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.032
for fungal infections.

00:00:59.536 --> 00:01:01.536
Severe pneumonia may require

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.096
hospitalization for 3 or 4 days

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:06.552
to receive intravenous medications,

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.248
supplementary oxygen,

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.504
and usually a chest x-ray.
