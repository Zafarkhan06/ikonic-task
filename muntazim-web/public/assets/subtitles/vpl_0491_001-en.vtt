00:00:00.368 --> 00:00:02.696
To accommodate your developing baby,

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:04.528
your uterus gets bigger as your

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.288
pregnancy progresses.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.808
The uterus first enlarges upward

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.144
and then outward.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.640
This expansion pushes the center of

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.256
your diaphragm out of its normal position,

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.208
so this dome-shaped muscle

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.680
under the lungs moves upwards about

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.792
4 centimeters, or 1 Â½ inches.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.032
As the diaphragm moves upward,

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.904
there is less room for your lungs to expand,

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.760
and the amount of oxygen your lungs

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.784
can take in is reduced.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.488
These changes can leave you

00:00:33.488 --> 00:00:35.144
feeling short of breath.
