00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.736
The sound of your voice

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:03.120
comes from the movement and

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.296
vibration of your vocal cords.

00:00:05.384 --> 00:00:08.096
These are 2 folds of mucous membrane

00:00:08.096 --> 00:00:10.090
that stretch across your larynx,

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:12.648
which is a tube shaped organ in your neck.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.208
When you breathe in,

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.144
your vocal cords are relaxed

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.168
and air passes through the larynx

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.000
without producing sound

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.864
Talking tightens the cords

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.312
through the action of muscles

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.816
and tendons within the mucous membranes,

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.776
which move them closer together

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:29.424
or further apart.

00:00:29.568 --> 00:00:31.296
Air is forced between them,

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:32.712
which makes them vibrate,

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.512
producing the sound that is your voice.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.776
Irritation, infection, or overuse

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.464
can cause the vocal cords

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.792
and larynx to become inflamed.

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.464
When air passes through them,

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.016
the sound is distorted,

00:00:46.016 --> 00:00:48.010
so that your speech sounds hoarse

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.032
or there may be almost no sound

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.280
what we call losing your voice.
