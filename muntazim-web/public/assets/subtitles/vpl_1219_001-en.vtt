00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.260
Bursitis is the painful swelling of a small,

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.900
fluid-filled sac called a bursa.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.680
These sacs act as a cushion

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.460
for areas where bone would otherwise

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.740
rub on muscle, tendons or skin.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.200
By padding these areas

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.020
they decrease friction, and inflammation.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.960
But due to overuse or excess pressure,

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.620
most often around joints,

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.380
a bursa can become irritated and painful.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.780
Common areas to develop bursitis are

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.700
the joints you use over and over, like the:

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:35.560
Shoulders

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.460
Elbows

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:37.280
Knees

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.120
Feet

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.140
Hips

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.100
Symptoms of bursitis include:

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.280
Pain, especially during movement

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.280
Swelling

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.040
Limited range of motion

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.240
Redness

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.780
Treatment typically involves

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.780
resting the affected joint and

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.580
protecting it from further trauma.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.660
Bursitis may come and go.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.000
Repeated flare-ups may damage the bursa

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.200
and reduce your mobility in that joint.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.900
Avoid sitting or kneeling too long.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.580
These positions put a lot of pressure on joints.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.840
Using cushions or pads when you kneel

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.340
or put weight on your elbows

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.660
can help avoid repeated injury.
