00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.380
A total knee replacement, or arthroplasty,

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.400
is a surgical procedure to remove damaged portions

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.660
of your knee joint and replace them with

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.360
plastic and metal implants. 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.980
The knee joint is formed by the femur or thigh bone;

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.000
the tibia (or shin bone);

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.620
and the patella (or knee cap).

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.000
The end of each bone is covered with a layer of

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.760
smooth cartilage that cushions and protects the

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.840
bones during movement.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.540
To begin the procedure,

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.160
your surgeon makes an incision

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.860
down the front of your knee.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.920
The first part of your knee that is exposed 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.600
is your patella, or kneecap.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.900
Your surgeon rotates the patella to the side.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.200
Damaged bone and cartilage at the end of your femur

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.960
is carefully measured and cut away. 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.420
Then your surgeon attaches the metal femoral component

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.560
to the end of your femur. 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.680
Next, your surgeon removes damaged bone and cartilage

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.760
at the top of the tibia and the bone is measured

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.240
and shaped to fit the tibial components.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.840
A metal tray is fit against the cut top

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.020
of the tibia and secured into place. 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.820
A plastic insert is snapped into the tibial tray.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.840
The femoral component slides on this tray

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.820
as you bend and flex your knee. 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.280
Before returning your patella to its normal position,

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.740
your surgeon may remove part of the bone

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.740
and fit it with a plastic piece

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.360
to ensure a proper fit with the rest of your implant. 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.960
Your surgeon will ensure correct balance,

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.700
alignment, position, and movement of your new knee.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.520
To finish the procedure,

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.660
your surgeon will close the incision with stitches or staples.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.300
Knee replacement can significantly reduce pain

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.100
and improve function.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.580
Like all surgeries, risks and complications are possible.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.160
Your doctor will explain these to you before surgery.
