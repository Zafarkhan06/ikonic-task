00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:03.860
How do vaccines work?

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.980
To understand how vaccines work,

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.900
let’s first go over how your body’s immune system works.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.840
When a germ like a virus or bacteria enters your body,

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.760
your immune system recognizes there is an invader

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.020
and sets off a complex chain of events.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.940
White blood cells in your immune system activate

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.820
and start making proteins called antibodies.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.300
Antibodies go to work

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.680
to destroy the virus or bacteria.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.000
Often, in the time it takes your immune system

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.180
to create the specific antibody to destroy the germ,

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.080
you experience some symptoms and feel sick.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.560
But by destroying the virus or bacteria,

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.120
your immune system and its antibodies help stop the infection

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.020
and can eventually help you feel well again. 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.360
Antibodies are unique

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.500
and are specific to different viruses and bacteria.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.680
Your immune system remembers the viruses

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.560
and bacteria that made you sick. 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.660
That way, the next time you are exposed

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.700
to the same virus or bacteria,

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.340
your immune system quickly activates the antibodies

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.540
already in your system and destroys the virus or bacteria

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.380
before it even has a chance to make you sick. 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.680
Vaccines work by training your immune system

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.660
to recognize specific viruses or bacteria and how to fight them. 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.020
Vaccines are made using killed or weakened versions of the virus or bacteria

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.380
or parts of the virus or bacteria called antigens.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.900
When you get a vaccine,

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.420
your immune system recognizes the invader.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.140
Your immune system responds by making antibodies

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.720
to the germ in the vaccine

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.160
the same as it would for the real virus or bacteria.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.980
Your immune system remembers this virus or bacteria

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.740
and now has the antibodies to destroy it.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.220
If you are exposed to the germ in the future,

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.280
your immune system has the antibodies

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.180
and will be able to quickly destroy the virus or bacteria

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.100
before it makes you sick. 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.700
It takes time to develop safe and effective vaccines.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.860
Vaccine development and testing

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.700
typically follows a standard set of steps.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.640
Early steps are exploratory

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.960
and involve researching and identifying parts

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.660
of a new virus or bacteria responsible for making you sick.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.460
Researchers develop these substances into vaccine candidates.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.060
Vaccines are evaluated through pre-clinical and

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.680
clinical studies to determine the safety and effectiveness.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.280
There are three phases of a clinical trial.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.280
Through each phase the vaccine needs to show it’s safe,

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.280
leads to a good immune response,

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.860
and provides protection against the virus or bacteria.
