00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.240
The hip is a ball and socket joint.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.260
The socket is part of your pelvis, or hip bone.

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:10.140
The ball is located at the top of your femur, or thighbone.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.880
Both are covered with a layer of smooth cartilage

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.400
that cushions and protects your bones when you move.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.440
A total hip replacement, or arthroplasty,

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.480
is a surgical procedure to remove

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.340
damaged portions of your hip joint

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.480
and replace them with plastic and metal implants.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.860
To begin the procedure,

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.920
your surgeon will make an incision over the front or side of your hip

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.920
then smooth and reshape the socket.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.900
Your surgeon will place a metal cup

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.400
into the prepared socket of the hip joint.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.900
The cup may be attached with surgical cement

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.920
or the outside of the cup may be rough

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.260
to help bone grow into its surface to lock it in place.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.600
Sometimes surgeons use a combination of glue and a rough cup.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.140
The cup has a plastic or ceramic liner

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.740
that works like cartilage as you move.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.240
Your surgeon will remove the damaged

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.980
ball-shaped head of your femur, or thighbone,

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.900
and implant a metal stem.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.520
Your surgeon will then attach a metal ball

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.460
to the stem which fits into the cup in the pelvis.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.460
Together, these components replace your ball and socket joint.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.960
Like all surgeries, risks and complications are possible.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.380
Your surgeon will explain these to you.
