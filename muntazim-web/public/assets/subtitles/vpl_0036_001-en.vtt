00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.912
The sinuses are a series

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:02.960
of interconnected,

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.976
hollow spaces in the skull.

00:00:05.304 --> 00:00:06.696
Their walls are lined with

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.840
mucus-secreting membranes.

00:00:08.904 --> 00:00:10.992
Small hairs sweep the mucus

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:12.248
out of the sinuses

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.440
so it can drain out

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.760
through your nose.

00:00:14.976 --> 00:00:16.704
These mucus membranes may

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.784
become infected or inflamed

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.984
because of a cold or allergies,

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.760
and can swell up and block

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.072
the nasal passages

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:25.184
so that the fluid from

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.112
the sinuses canâ€™t drain.

00:00:27.568 --> 00:00:29.888
Buildup of fluid in the sinuses

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.960
causes pressure and pain.

00:00:32.168 --> 00:00:34.616
Doctors call this sinusitis.

00:00:34.768 --> 00:00:36.736
Acute sinusitis comes on

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.560
quickly and then leaves.

00:00:38.688 --> 00:00:40.736
With chronic sinusitis,

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.584
people have symptoms virtually

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:43.712
all the time

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.048
and take many courses of medications,

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.392
such as antibiotics,

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.040
to treat the inflammation.

00:00:49.264 --> 00:00:51.040
Severe sinusitis

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.064
may require surgical opening

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.168
of the passageways with rigid,

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.000
steel instruments placed up

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.056
through the nostril

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.240
to remove bone

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.504
and tissue blocking the drainage.

00:01:02.016 --> 00:01:05.632
Recently, a new, less invasive technology

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.592
called balloon sinuplasty

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.928
has been introduced.

00:01:09.048 --> 00:01:10.864
Using this technology,

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.856
a balloon catheter is delivered

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.560
to the blocked passageway

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.344
and is gently inflated,

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.096
widening the opening of the passageway,

00:01:19.288 --> 00:01:21.090
and thus allowing drainage

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.584
and relief of the pain and pressure.
