00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.648
Hammer toe is a deformity

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:03.160
caused by a permanent bend at

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:04.496
the middle joint of a toe.

00:00:04.496 --> 00:00:06.490
The middle of the toe bends upwards

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:08.136
while the tip points downward,

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.376
causing the toe to resemble a hammer.

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.456
A person with a hammer toe may also have

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.736
corns or calluses on the top of the joint

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:15.880
bending upward

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.632
or the tip bending downward. 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.176
Hammer toe is commonly caused

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.376
by wearing shoes that are

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:21.608
too short or tight,

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.392
have narrow pointy toes,

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.096
and heels that are too high.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:26.488
Shoes that are too short

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.744
or narrow and pointy

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.360
push the smaller toes into a bent position.

00:00:30.648 --> 00:00:31.944
Very high heels

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:32.944
shift your weight forward

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.248
onto your toes.

00:00:34.448 --> 00:00:35.720
When the toes are forced

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.184
against the front of the shoe,

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.272
they bend under.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:39.904
If the tendons that straighten

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.344
and bend the toes are held in one

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.592
position too long,

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.736
they tighten and canâ€™t stretch out.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:45.688
If caught early

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.080
and the toe is still flexible,

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.456
hammer toe may be treated

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.104
by wearing roomier footwear.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.576
Once the toe is rigid,

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.416
surgery may be needed to straighten it

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:54.568
by cutting the tendon

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.912
and sometimes removing pieces of bone.
