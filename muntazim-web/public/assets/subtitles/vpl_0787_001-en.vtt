00:00:01.816 --> 00:00:04.832
Your pancreas is a long slender organ that lies

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.968
behind the stomach and intestines, near the spine.

00:00:08.952 --> 00:00:10.848
This delicate but vital gland

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.912
is responsible for regulating your bodies

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.728
blood sugar with hormones such as insulin,

00:00:17.024 --> 00:00:20.848
and for helping breakdown food with digestive enzymes.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.040
The pancreas is divided into four parts:

00:00:26.256 --> 00:00:27.112
the head,

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.200
the neck,

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.136
the body,

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.488
and the tail.

00:00:32.024 --> 00:00:34.024
When cancer develops in the body or

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.368
tail of the pancreas,

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.640
your surgeon performs a distal pancreatectomy

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.184
to remove the cancer.

00:00:40.672 --> 00:00:42.680
This surgery may also be used

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.312
to remove premalignant masses within the pancreas.

00:00:46.992 --> 00:00:49.656
Before beginning a distal pancreatectomy

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.632
a patient is put under general anesthesia.

00:00:53.272 --> 00:00:54.472
Your surgeon will then make 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.856
one or more incisions in the abdomen.

00:00:56.976 --> 00:00:59.064
Depending upon the preferred approach.

00:00:59.304 --> 00:01:00.672
Subcostal,

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:01.816
midline,

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.192
or through several small incisions,

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.736
known as a laparoscopic or robot-assisted approach.

00:01:09.168 --> 00:01:11.520
The cancerous tissue in the tail or

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.640
distal end of the pancreas,

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.008
is identified and removed.

00:01:18.616 --> 00:01:22.440
The spleen, an organ involved in filtering the blood

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.440
and helping the immune system,

00:01:27.344 --> 00:01:30.872
shares its blood supply with the tail of the pancreas.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.192
This often necessitates the removal of the spleen,

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:35.624
splenic artery,

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.032
splenic vein,

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.936
and overlying lymph nodes,

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.072
along with the tail of the pancreas.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.064
This is known as a distal pancreatectomy

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.392
with splenectomy.

00:01:45.512 --> 00:01:47.600
This operation can also be done without

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.840
removing the spleen for noncancerous

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.824
or premalignant masses.

00:01:52.312 --> 00:01:55.384
A distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.960
is usually very successful at eliminating

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.024
cancer within the body or tail of the pancreas.

00:02:01.376 --> 00:02:03.024
It is a major operation,

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.776
that usually takes 3-4 hours.

00:02:06.152 --> 00:02:08.520
Most patients are fully recovered and back

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.800
to daily routines within a week.
