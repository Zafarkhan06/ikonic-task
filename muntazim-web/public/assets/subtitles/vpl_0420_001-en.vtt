00:00:01.056 --> 00:00:04.184
During surgery, the surgeon tests to see

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:05.784
how well the valve will function

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:06.976
after repair.

00:00:07.552 --> 00:00:09.080
If there is any chance that

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.736
the repair may not last,

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.296
the valve is then replaced

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.024
during the same operation.

00:00:14.784 --> 00:00:16.544
The advantage of repairing

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.368
rather than replacing the valve

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.200
is that the patient will not require

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.336
lifelong blood thinning medication.

00:00:23.064 --> 00:00:25.288
In addition, maintaining the structure

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.488
of your own valve

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.272
is better than having a replacement,

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:29.600
prosthetic valve.

00:00:30.264 --> 00:00:31.704
We replace your valve

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.144
with a prosthetic valve

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.592
when either your own valve

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.320
is too damaged for repair,

00:00:36.552 --> 00:00:39.152
or you request a replacement valve.

00:00:39.928 --> 00:00:41.064
For replacement,

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.376
we use a mechanical, prosthetic valve

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:44.888
or a tissue valve.
