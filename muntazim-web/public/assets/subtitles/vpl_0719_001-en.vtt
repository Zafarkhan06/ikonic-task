00:00:01.096 --> 00:00:02.360
TAVI stands for

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.624
transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

00:00:05.696 --> 00:00:07.672
This is a new procedure for replacing a

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:09.976
faulty aortic valve in the heart.

00:00:10.472 --> 00:00:12.824
The aortic valve opens to permit

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.088
blood to flow from the left ventricle

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.432
into the aorta,

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.976
which carries blood to the rest of the body. 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.312
The valve closes between heartbeats

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:22.968
to prevent blood from flowing

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.584
back into the ventricle

00:00:24.968 --> 00:00:26.928
If the aortic valve does not

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.832
open or close properly,

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.848
the heart has to work harder to pump

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.496
blood into the aorta.

00:00:32.752 --> 00:00:34.424
This can cause symptoms such as

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.464
chest pain and shortness of breath 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.344
and may ultimately lead to heart failure.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.888
Treatment of a faulty aortic valve

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.688
generally requires open heart surgery. 

00:00:44.808 --> 00:00:47.168
The surgeon cuts through the chest bone,

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.536
stops the heart,

00:00:48.536 --> 00:00:50.530
removes the faulty valve,

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.456
and replaces it with a mechanical

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.368
or biological valve.

00:00:54.912 --> 00:00:57.248
With TAVI, an artificial valve

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.472
is implanted via a catheter,

00:00:59.616 --> 00:01:01.656
which is navigated to the heart through an

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.512
artery via an incision in the skin.

00:01:04.704 --> 00:01:06.600
The femoral artery in the leg is

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.992
most often used,

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.360
but others such as the subclavian artery

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.112
beneath the collar bone may also be used.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.968
The replacement valve is placed

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.352
inside the existing valve.

00:01:18.136 --> 00:01:21.016
The procedure is performed on the beating heart,

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.704
without the need for a heart lung machine.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.240
Both procedure and recovery time

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.376
are significantly reduced.
