00:00:02.088 --> 00:00:04.504
There are three stages of labor.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.488
Each of these stages varies

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.552
according to the woman

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.296
and many other factors.

00:00:09.808 --> 00:00:12.256
The first stage includes early labor,

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.528
when the cervix thins (effacement)

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.624
and begins to open (dilate)

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.872
from zero to three centimeters.

00:00:19.232 --> 00:00:21.920
This stage may take hours or days.

00:00:22.456 --> 00:00:24.064
During active labor,

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.800
the cervix opens further,

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.632
and contractions become stronger

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.952
and more frequent. 

00:00:29.416 --> 00:00:30.864
Transition follows with

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.928
the cervix becoming fully dilated

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.392
to ten centimeters,

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.984
and the second stage of labor begins.

00:00:38.112 --> 00:00:39.656
Contractions in this stage

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:40.792
become stronger

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.112
as the baby is pushed

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:43.680
down the birth canal.

00:00:43.944 --> 00:00:45.144
The head crowns

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.536
(is seen from outside),

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.096
and the baby is finally delivered.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.520
The second stage can last

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.432
minutes to hours.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.040
During the third stage,

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.904
soon after the birth of the baby,

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.712
the placenta is delivered.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:59.784
The third stage,

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.416
or placental delivery,

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.944
usually occurs within

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.832
ten minutes of birth.
