00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.984
Air flows in and out of the lungs

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.264
through tubes called airways.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:10.160
In COPD, or Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease,

00:00:10.344 --> 00:00:12.936
the walls of the two large airways,

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.448
called bronchi, are damaged and thickened.

00:00:16.872 --> 00:00:19.728
The channel air passes through is narrowed,

00:00:19.728 --> 00:00:21.720
which makes it harder to breathe.

00:00:22.552 --> 00:00:25.024
Cells in the airways that produce mucus

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.824
become larger, producing more mucus,

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.088
which causes a phlegmy cough.

00:00:31.432 --> 00:00:34.016
COPD also causes changes in the

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.048
smaller airways, called the bronchioles.

00:00:37.288 --> 00:00:39.200
They become inflamed in response

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.784
to irritating particles and gases in cigarette smoke.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.248
Excess fluid accumulates

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.720
and inflammatory cells gather.

00:00:48.352 --> 00:00:50.216
They release a continuous stream of

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.792
substances that produce inflammation.

00:00:53.096 --> 00:00:55.336
The substances enter the airway walls

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.192
and airspaces, or alveoli,

00:00:58.192 --> 00:01:00.190
at the end of the bronchioles.

00:01:01.344 --> 00:01:03.808
The small airways are normally held open

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.136
by attachments to the elastic airspace walls.

00:01:07.824 --> 00:01:09.416
When the walls are damaged,

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.648
the small airways collapse.

00:01:11.912 --> 00:01:14.408
Air is trapped in the alveoli;

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.704
it is harder to fully exhale

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.240
or to fill the lungs when you inhale,

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.752
which leaves your body without the oxygen it needs.
