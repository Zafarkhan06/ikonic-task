00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.500
The goal of a chemical peel is to

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.820
reduce wrinkles, uneven color and scars.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.180
They are often used on your face

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.020
but can also be used on your neck, chest or hands.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.220
Your dermatologist will apply one or more

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.340
chemical solutions to your skin.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.400
This causes the top layer

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.580
or layers of your skin to peel off.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.240
Your new skin is usually smoother,

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.120
less wrinkled and more even looking.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.720
A chemical peel can be done at

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.720
different depths (or strengths),

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.300
from light to deep.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.880
A light or superficial peel uses a mild acid.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.440
This peel affects only the

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.160
outer most layer of your skin, the epidermis,

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.760
to gently remove dead skin cells.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.300
It’s used to improve the appearance of mild

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.260
uneven color, fine lines, and rough texture.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.820
A medium peel affects the epidermis and parts of the dermis

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.980
(the middle layer of your skin).

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.660
It’s used to improve the appearance of wrinkles,

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.360
uneven color, and acne scars.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.900
It can also be used to smooth rough skin

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.860
and treat some precancerous skin growths.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.240
A deep chemical peel affects

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.800
deeper parts of the dermis.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.080
It may offer more dramatic results,

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.460
but also takes longer to recover from.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.460
It’s used for deep wrinkles,

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.340
scars, or precancerous growths.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.740
After a chemical peel of any depth,

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.740
your skin will be red, tight, irritated or swollen

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.980
and may look like you have a sunburn.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.900
Your doctor will tell you

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.440
how to care for your skin as it heals.
