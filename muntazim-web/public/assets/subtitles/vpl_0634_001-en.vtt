00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.112
All the cells in your body need oxygen.

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:05.304
Oxygen moves around your body

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.984
in red blood cells.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:08.664
If you have anemia,

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.240
you don’t have enough healthy red blood cells

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.528
to give them the oxygen they need.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.928
Red blood cells are made in soft,

00:00:15.944 --> 00:00:18.016
spongy tissue called bone marrow

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:19.848
in the center of bones.

00:00:19.904 --> 00:00:22.112
They carry oxygen from your lungs

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.280
to cells throughout your body.

00:00:24.368 --> 00:00:26.600
The red blood cells contain proteins

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.912
called hemoglobin,

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.344
which give red blood cells their color.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.776
Hemoglobin is made up of sequences of

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.368
amino acids with an iron atom,

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.544
which can bind to a molecule of oxygen.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.032
The hemoglobin releases the oxygen

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.440
to cells as the blood passes through

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.160
your body’s tissues.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.200
There are different types of anemia

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.856
and different causes.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.024
Your body may not make enough red blood cells,

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.088
or you may lose them through bleeding,

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.328
or your body may destroy them.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.376
In a common type called iron-deficiency anemia,

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.064
your body does not have enough

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:03.952
iron to make hemoglobin.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.912
Without it, the red blood cells

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.864
cannot carry oxygen.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.632
This can result in a variety of symptoms

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.256
such as fatigue and lack of energy.
