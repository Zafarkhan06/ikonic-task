00:00:00.408 --> 00:00:02.088
When you hear a medical term

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:03.464
that ends in “itis”

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.056
it means something is inflamed.

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:10.088
Tracheobronchitis is inflammation of the trachea

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.608
your main airway — and bronchi

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.072
the smaller branching airways going into your lungs. 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.264
There are many airborne organisms, such as viruses,

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.704
that can cause infection

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.568
and inflammation of the trachea and bronchi.

00:00:23.736 --> 00:00:25.720
If you breathe in virus particles

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.256
that are floating in the air,

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.568
they can bind to hair-like structures on the

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.456
surface of cells lining the airways.

00:00:32.536 --> 00:00:34.280
They can then enter the cells

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.072
and begin to multiply.

00:00:36.384 --> 00:00:38.504
Eventually the cells they have invaded

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.664
die and redness and inflammation develop.

00:00:42.048 --> 00:00:43.952
As your immune system tries to

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.104
fight the inflammation and infection,

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.392
the lining of the bronchi swell

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.648
and more mucus is produced.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.496
Less air is able to flow

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.152
to and from the lungs,

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.384
and mucus can accumulate in your airways.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.672
This can result in a cough with green sputum,

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.984
as your body tries to clear the accumulated mucus,

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.000
as well as soreness in the chest,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.896
and sometimes mild shortness of breath.
