00:00:00.184 --> 00:00:01.952
People with diabetes have

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:05.112
too much glucose—sugar—in their blood.

00:00:05.224 --> 00:00:07.576
Glucose is a form of sugar.

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.488
It is formed from the breakdown of foods we eat,

00:00:10.488 --> 00:00:12.480
especially carbohydrates.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.280
After a meal, it is absorbed

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.928
from the intestines into the bloodstream.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.952
Normally, the glucose binds to receptors

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:21.896
on cells in the pancreas,

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.760
which triggers the cells to release

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.000
a hormone called insulin into the bloodstream. 

00:00:27.216 --> 00:00:29.496
The insulin allows the glucose to be

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.192
transported from the blood into cells

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:33.608
for use as fuel.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.520
Cells have an outer wall, or membrane,

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.632
which controls what goes in and out of the cell.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.664
Insulin binds to receptors

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.368
on the cell membrane.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.896
This activates protein molecules

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:46.840
on the membrane

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.424
that allow the glucose to enter the cell.

00:00:49.512 --> 00:00:51.824
The cells can then use glucose as

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.584
energy to carry out their functions.

00:00:54.816 --> 00:00:57.648
In people with type 1 diabetes,

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.160
no insulin is produced in response

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.160
to blood glucose levels.

00:01:02.352 --> 00:01:04.488
People with type 2 diabetes

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.944
produce insulin

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.640
but their bodies don’t use it properly.

00:01:08.968 --> 00:01:11.600
Without insulin, the cells can’t

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.592
easily access the calories in the glucose.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.392
So even if a person eats a lot of food,

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.896
their cells may be starving.

00:01:20.104 --> 00:01:23.304
And high blood sugar—called hyperglycemia

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.664
can have serious complications if it

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.368
occurs for an extended period of time.

00:01:28.496 --> 00:01:30.040
It can result in damage to the

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.200
kidneys, nerves, heart, and eyes.

00:01:33.288 --> 00:01:36.896
Very high blood sugar is a medical emergency.
