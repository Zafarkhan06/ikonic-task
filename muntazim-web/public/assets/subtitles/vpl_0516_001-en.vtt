00:00:00.184 --> 00:00:01.472
The nose is lined with

00:00:01.472 --> 00:00:03.470
moist mucous membrane.

00:00:04.064 --> 00:00:05.808
Breathing in dry air

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.128
especially indoor heat in the winter

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.920
can dry out and irritate the membranes.

00:00:11.352 --> 00:00:13.608
Dried out mucus and membranes,

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.720
and the nose-picking that

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:15.992
often accompanies it,

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.912
are the most common causes of nose bleeds.

00:00:19.056 --> 00:00:20.560
There are many blood vessels

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.496
in and around the nose.

00:00:22.752 --> 00:00:24.320
They are close to the surface

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.144
and help to warm and humidify

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.616
the air you breathe in.

00:00:28.072 --> 00:00:30.864
Their location makes them easy to injure.

00:00:31.032 --> 00:00:32.664
A nose bleed occurs when

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.888
one of these blood vessels ruptures.

00:00:35.464 --> 00:00:37.272
Most nose bleeds occur from the

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:38.480
rupture of blood vessels

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.480
in the front part of the nose.
