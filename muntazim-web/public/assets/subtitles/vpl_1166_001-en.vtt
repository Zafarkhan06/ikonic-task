00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.260
Atherosclerosis is a build up of thick,

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.260
fatty deposits, called plaque,

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.600
on the inside walls of your arteries.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.100
As plaque builds up,

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.140
blood flow through the artery is slowed or blocked.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.020
Reduced blow flow lessens the amount of oxygen

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.040
and other nutrients reaching the body.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.820
Atherosclerosis can occur

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.500
in any artery in your body.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.140
Mild atherosclerosis

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.280
doesnâ€™t usually have any symptoms.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.340
Symptoms for moderate or severe atherosclerosis

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.560
depend on what arteries are affected.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.940
Arteries in your heart,

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.640
close to your brain, kidneys,

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.900
or in your arms and legs can be affected.
