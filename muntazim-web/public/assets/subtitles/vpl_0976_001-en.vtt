00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.100
Histamine H2 receptor antagonists

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.300
also known as H2 blockers,

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.120
are drugs that relieve stomach indigestion.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.360
Histamine aids in digestion

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.780
and is triggered when food enters the digestive tract.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.840
When histamine activates H2 receptors

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.940
Acidic juices are made that break down food in the stomach.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.640
Preventing histamine from stimulating H2 receptors

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.180
reduces acidic juice made in the stomach to relieve

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.160
and or prevent heartburn,

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.940
acid indigestion and sour stomach.
