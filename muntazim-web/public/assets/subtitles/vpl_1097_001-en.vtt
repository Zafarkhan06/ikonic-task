00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.420
A heart attack occurs when

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.700
blood flow to the heart is blocked.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.880
The blockage is often from thick,

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.960
fatty deposits, called plaque,

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.980
on the inside walls of your coronary arteries.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.300
The coronary arteries supply blood and oxygen to the heart.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.180
This buildup of plaque in the coronary arteries

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.240
is called Coronary Artery Disease.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.560
Sometimes a plaque can break,

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.220
and the body forms a clot that blocks blood flow.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.940
Without blood and oxygen,

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.620
your heart tissue can be damaged or dies,

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.340
causing a heart attack.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.840
Symptoms of a heart attack vary.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.280
Some people have early warning signs

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.060
while others experience no symptoms.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.820
Symptoms commonly reported include:

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.580
tightness or pain in the chest, neck, back, or arms

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.040
Nausea

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.640
Sweating

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.360
Trouble breathing

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.840
Fatigue

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.180
Dizziness or sudden lightheadedness

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.220
A heart attack is a medical emergency.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.600
Call 911 or seek immediate medical help

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.240
if you or someone you know

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.420
is experiencing symptoms of a heart attack.
