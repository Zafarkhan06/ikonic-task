00:00:01.424 --> 00:00:05.232
In peripheral artery disease, or PAD,

00:00:05.368 --> 00:00:07.480
fatty material called plaque

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.288
builds up inside the peripheral arteries,

00:00:10.424 --> 00:00:13.064
which supply blood and oxygen to your limbs.

00:00:13.216 --> 00:00:17.576
Most commonly PAD affects the pelvis and legs.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.968
Plaque can reduce the blood flow,

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.800
so the cells in your legs

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.744
donâ€™t get the oxygen they need.

00:00:24.112 --> 00:00:27.096
This can cause symptoms such as pain and cramping

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.968
during times when your cells need more oxygen,

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.680
such as when you walk or exercise.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.864
The calf muscles are most often affected.

00:00:36.112 --> 00:00:39.584
However, PAD is often undiagnosed

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.536
or does not cause symptoms.

00:00:41.688 --> 00:00:43.584
Scientists are now finding

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.576
that erectile dysfunction, or ED,

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.904
can be a marker for undiagnosed PAD. 

00:00:50.064 --> 00:00:52.216
Erection occurs when blood flows into

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.416
chambers that run the length of the penis

00:00:54.448 --> 00:00:55.816
and is trapped there.

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.352
In ED, an erection is hard to produce.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.528
ED has been linked to build up of

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.144
plaque in blood vessels

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.088
that is not yet causing signs and symptoms.

00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:09.688
Men with ED are more likely to have PAD.

00:01:09.928 --> 00:01:11.624
The likelihood increases

00:01:11.624 --> 00:01:13.620
as ED becomes more frequent.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.248
If you have ED,

00:01:15.288 --> 00:01:17.144
ask your doctor whether you would benefit

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.032
from testing for PAD.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.016
Severe PAD can cause permanent damage

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.152
to tissue in the lower legs and feet

00:01:24.304 --> 00:01:26.568
due to lack of blood and oxygen.

00:01:26.904 --> 00:01:28.792
Early detection and treatment

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.144
can help prevent damage from occurring.
