00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:03.048
Shoulder dystocia is a rare and

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.392
serious complication of child birth.

00:00:05.976 --> 00:00:07.112
After the babyâ€™s head

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:08.224
has been delivered,

00:00:08.368 --> 00:00:10.648
one or both shoulders are stuck

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.304
and cannot be delivered.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.392
Dystocia increases the risk

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:15.688
of complications for both

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.472
the mother and the baby.

00:00:18.152 --> 00:00:20.080
Multiple maneuvers are employed

00:00:20.096 --> 00:00:21.552
to resolve the problem.
