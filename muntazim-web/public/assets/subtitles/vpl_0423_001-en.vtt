00:00:00.304 --> 00:00:01.864
Time and temperature

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.616
in food-borne illness.

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:05.400
Cold foods must be held

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.784
below 41 degrees fahrenheit.

00:00:08.088 --> 00:00:10.552
Food that remains in the danger zone,

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.840
41 degrees to 140 degrees fahrenheit,

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.368
for more than 4 hours

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.104
may result in illness.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.576
So thawing food at

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.824
room temperature is dangerous.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.240
Bacteria and viruses thrive

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.720
in the danger zone.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.272
Safe food must be frozen,

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.032
thawed, cooked,

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:30.872
and re-heated to the correct

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.456
temperature for the correct length of time.
