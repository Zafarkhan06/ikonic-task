00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.608
Americans spend millions of dollars

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.640
on supplements each year.

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.808
One of the most common and important,

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.248
especially for women, is calcium.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.128
Ideally, it should be taken with magnesium,

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.624
which is important for calcium absorption.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.624
But why is it so important

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.648
and what happens when you take it?

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.952
First, it goes down the esophagus

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.112
to your stomach, where it dissolves.

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.216
The nutrients then enter the small intestine. 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.312
They are absorbed through the walls of the small intestine

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.552
and enter the circulatory system.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.680
This system is made up of your heart,

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.312
blood vessels and blood.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.856
It is responsible for transporting oxygen

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.344
and nutrients to all of the cells of your body.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.184
This includes your bones.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.136
Although they are made up of minerals,

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.160
including calcium, phosphorous and sodium,

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.368
they also contain blood vessels,

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.304
nerves, the protein collagen, and living cells.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.816
Besides being a component of bones,

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.136
calcium is also stored in them.

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.168
It is released when needed for other vital functions,

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.056
like regulating your blood pressure and heart rate.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.288
If your body needs more calcium than it is getting,

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.752
it is broken down and sent back into your bloodstream.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.256
Over a long period, this can create

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.728
holes in the bones, which weaken them.

00:01:15.848 --> 00:01:17.720
Taking a calcium supplement

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.408
helps to prevent the bones from breaking down.
