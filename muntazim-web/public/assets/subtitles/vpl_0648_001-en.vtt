00:00:00.712 --> 00:00:03.088
Oxygen is carried by red blood cells

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:04.680
and delivered to the heart muscle

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.888
via the coronary arteries.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.584
Over the years, the insides of the

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:11.920
coronary arteries can narrow.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.288
The most common cause is a build-up of plaque.

00:00:15.504 --> 00:00:18.632
As the insides of the arteries become narrow,

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.504
blood flow is reduced,

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.216
and your heart has to work harder

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.568
to get the oxygen it needs.

00:00:24.736 --> 00:00:27.760
Sometimes plaque that has built up breaks apart,

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.080
or a blood clot forms, and blood flow

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.344
to the heart is suddenly and severely reduced.

00:00:33.584 --> 00:00:36.064
The pain does not go away with rest

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.448
or the medications that relieve stable angina.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.280
This condition is called unstable angina.

00:00:43.368 --> 00:00:45.240
It is a medical emergency

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.944
because without blood-carrying oxygen,

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.112
the heart muscle dies.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.816
This death of heart muscle

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.472
due to lack of oxygen

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.296
is what we commonly call a heart attack.
