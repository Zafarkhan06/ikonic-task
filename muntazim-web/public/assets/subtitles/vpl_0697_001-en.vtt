00:00:00.712 --> 00:00:01.992
Many people have heard of

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:05.912
peripheral arterial disease, or PAD,

00:00:06.144 --> 00:00:08.296
but they’re not sure what it means. 

00:00:08.912 --> 00:00:11.680
Your arteries are a network of blood vessels

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.456
that carry oxygen-rich blood

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:14.760
throughout your body. 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.488
PAD is a type of atherosclerosis,

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.352
which means there is a gradual build up

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.536
of fatty material called plaque

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:23.976
inside an artery.

00:00:24.616 --> 00:00:26.144
As plaque builds up,

00:00:26.296 --> 00:00:27.512
it can reduce the flow of

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.680
blood and oxygen in the artery. 

00:00:30.576 --> 00:00:32.448
The part of the body affected 

00:00:32.584 --> 00:00:34.952
depends on where the artery is located.

00:00:35.584 --> 00:00:37.888
In coronary artery disease,

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.648
build up of plaque in the coronary arteries

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.528
reduces the flow of blood and oxygen to the heart.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.792
This is the most common cause of heart attacks.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.600
In PAD, plaque builds up in the arteries

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.864
that supply blood to your extremities,

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.624
especially your legs. 

00:00:54.968 --> 00:00:56.872
When blood flow is reduced,

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.680
the muscle cells in your legs

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.640
don’t get the oxygen they need.

00:01:00.888 --> 00:01:02.616
This can cause symptoms like pain

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.280
and cramping when you walk or exercise,

00:01:05.504 --> 00:01:07.904
especially in your calf muscles.

00:01:08.104 --> 00:01:10.920
Other symptoms include cold feet and legs,

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.824
changes in skin color,

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.872
sores that won’t heal,

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.032
altered sensation, and loss of hair.

00:01:18.456 --> 00:01:20.280
If the narrowing is severe,

00:01:20.408 --> 00:01:22.888
it can cause permanent damage to tissue

00:01:23.016 --> 00:01:25.152
due to lack of blood and oxygen.

00:01:25.512 --> 00:01:27.664
If you have symptoms of PAD,

00:01:27.904 --> 00:01:29.952
it’s important to talk to your doctor

00:01:29.952 --> 00:01:31.950
before damage occurs.
