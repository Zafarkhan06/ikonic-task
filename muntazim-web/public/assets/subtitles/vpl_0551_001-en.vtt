00:00:00.104 --> 00:00:02.192
A fertilized egg develops into a

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.208
baby inside the uterus.

00:00:04.304 --> 00:00:05.928
Most of the time, however,

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.128
an egg is not fertilized.

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.080
Blood and tissue that have built up

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.224
inside the uterus in preparation for pregnancy

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.504
are shed through menstruation.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:16.880
This cycle is repeated

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.880
for each menstrual cycle.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.816
Although menstruation occurs

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.248
on average every 28 days,

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.632
there is wide variation in the timing

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.528
and duration of normal menstrual cycles.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.000
Many women find that the flow becomes

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.592
lighter as they get older,

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.912
which reflects reduced build up of blood

00:00:34.912 --> 00:00:36.910
and tissue inside the uterus

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.512
with increasing age.
