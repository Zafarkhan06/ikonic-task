00:00:00.304 --> 00:00:03.032
Beneath your liver and behind your stomach,

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.224
you have a fish-shaped gland called your pancreas.

00:00:07.584 --> 00:00:10.000
The head of the pancreas, on the right side,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.248
is connected to the small intestine,

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.920
where most digestion takes place.

00:00:15.632 --> 00:00:17.488
The pancreas secretes chemicals

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.424
that help you digest food.

00:00:19.824 --> 00:00:22.672
It also produces the hormone insulin

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.256
shown here as green particles

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.136
when blood levels of glucose increase.

00:00:28.376 --> 00:00:31.208
Glucose, shown as white particles,

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.280
is a type of sugar that comes from

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.560
carbohydrate-containing foods.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.840
Normally, insulin “unlocks” cells

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.736
allowing glucose to move out of your bloodstream

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.816
into your cells for energy.

00:00:44.184 --> 00:00:45.904
Insulin is produced until

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.992
blood glucose levels fall below a certain level.

00:00:49.424 --> 00:00:51.312
The insulin attaches to cells

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.784
on the walls of blood vessels, liver, muscles and fat.

00:00:56.144 --> 00:01:00.600
In response, the cells absorb glucose out of the blood.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.016
In type 1 diabetes,

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.320
the pancreas produces little or no insulin.

00:01:06.608 --> 00:01:08.536
In type 2 diabetes,

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.288
the pancreas does not produce enough insulin

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.744
or the cells it attaches to do not respond.

00:01:15.152 --> 00:01:17.272
If glucose is not absorbed,

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.120
blood levels stay high,

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.936
which can lead to serious health problems.

00:01:22.672 --> 00:01:26.544
Too much glucose damages the walls of blood vessels.

00:01:26.704 --> 00:01:28.560
This damage increases the risk of

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.024
developing complications of diabetes,

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.376
including eye disease, called retinopathy;

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:39.344
heart disease; kidney disease, called nephropathy;

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.896
and nerve disease, called neuropathy.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.936
Treatment options are available.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.736
See your doctor for further information.
