00:00:00.096 --> 00:00:02.584
Prolonged exposure to extreme cold

00:00:02.656 --> 00:00:05.416
can damage skin and underlying tissue,

00:00:05.512 --> 00:00:07.360
known as frostbite.

00:00:07.448 --> 00:00:09.936
At first, your skin may turn red,

00:00:10.104 --> 00:00:11.928
and then white or pale

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.336
as your body reduces

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.256
blood flow to your extremities

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.144
to maintain your core temperature

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.920
and to protect vital organs,

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.664
such as your heart and brain,

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.136
from becoming cold and damaged.

00:00:23.336 --> 00:00:25.120
To reduce blood flow,

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.728
the blood vessels close to the

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.520
skinâ€™s surface narrow.

00:00:28.736 --> 00:00:30.736
To preserve blood flow and function

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.168
of your hands and feet,

00:00:32.304 --> 00:00:35.544
the blood vessels alternately widen and narrow

00:00:35.896 --> 00:00:37.656
but with continued exposure,

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.472
they permanently constrict.

00:00:39.736 --> 00:00:42.920
About 60 percent of your body weight is water.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.312
When skin heat drops too low,

00:00:45.464 --> 00:00:48.656
water between the skin cells forms ice crystals

00:00:48.776 --> 00:00:51.680
and is also lost from inside the cells.

00:00:51.888 --> 00:00:54.264
Both cause skin cells to die.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.832
Continued exposure also damages blood vessels

00:00:57.936 --> 00:01:00.224
so that blood flow is further impeded,

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.048
small clots form

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.704
and the vessels leak.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.568
Depending on the severity,

00:01:05.696 --> 00:01:07.960
 frostbitten skin may turn purple

00:01:07.984 --> 00:01:10.072
or blue as it rewarms,

00:01:10.256 --> 00:01:13.472
or black and hard as tissue dies.
