00:00:00.256 --> 00:00:02.424
Your lungs expand to bring in life’s

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:05.480
essential gas, oxygen from the air.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.968
Expanded lungs naturally contract

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.544
to expel the body’s waste gas, carbon dioxide.

00:00:11.944 --> 00:00:13.680
Your lungs usually expand

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.968
and contract in two main ways. 

00:00:16.152 --> 00:00:18.096
One is an unconscious downward

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.032
and upward movement of a thin muscle

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:21.528
called the diaphragm,

00:00:21.712 --> 00:00:24.176
which separates the chest from the belly.

00:00:25.536 --> 00:00:27.736
The other way is by raising or lowering

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.120
the ribs to increase

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.648
or decrease the volume of the chest cavity.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.968
We breathe in or inhale

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.080
when the diaphragm contracts;

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.936
this pulls the lower part of the lungs downward.

00:00:39.024 --> 00:00:41.232
When we breathe out or exhale,

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.536
the diaphragm and lungs relax

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.056
and return to their resting positions.

00:00:46.264 --> 00:00:48.416
Quiet, deep belly breathing

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.040
is a more consciously-controlled breathing that,

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.624
with practice, can become the standard way you breathe.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.448
Deep belly breathing aids the diaphragm

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.184
muscle movement by expanding

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.704
and contracting the abdomen,

00:01:00.864 --> 00:01:02.784
the area below the diaphragm.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.088
This allows the belly muscles to push

00:01:05.088 --> 00:01:07.080
stomach and diaphragm up,

00:01:07.312 --> 00:01:10.088
which forces out more carbon dioxide waste.
