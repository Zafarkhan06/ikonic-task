00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.580
There are two different types of COVID-19 testing,

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.300
diagnostic and antibody testing.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.020
Antibody testing uses a blood sample.

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.440
The test determines if a person was infected

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.160
with the virus in the past.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.960
It is not able to differentiate

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.540
between current and prior infections.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.340
Diagnostic testing uses a nasal or oral swab

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.780
to determine if someone is currently infected with SARS-CoV-2.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.900
Diagnostic testing falls two categories,

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.740
antigen tests and molecular tests.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.920
There are pros and cons to each type of COVID-19 test.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.200
Antigen testing looks for proteins

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.060
on the outside of the virus.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.280
Antigen tests are relatively fast and inexpensive.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.940
However, they are less accurate

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.640
and not sensitive enough for use by asymptomatic carriers.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.380
That means a negative result from an antigen test

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.460
may not mean that a patient is free of infection. 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.380
A PCR test is a molecular test

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.020
that looks for the genetic material of the virus.

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:06.500
In PCR testing,

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.140
viral RNA is converted to DNA and amplified,

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.620
using a thermal process, until they can be detected.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.620
Because a PCR test can run

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.760
multiple cycles of this amplification,

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.160
it can detect the virus even if there is a

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.860
low level of the viral RNA in the sample.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.240
PCR is extremely accurate

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.640
but is relatively slow and costly.
