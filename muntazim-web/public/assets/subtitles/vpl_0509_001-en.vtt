00:00:00.264 --> 00:00:02.216
People who are sun worshipers

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:04.224
and especially those with fair skin

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.128
and blonde or red hair

00:00:06.264 --> 00:00:08.344
are at higher risk for developing the most

00:00:08.344 --> 00:00:10.340
serious type of skin cancer,

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.296
known as melanoma.

00:00:12.472 --> 00:00:14.816
Melanomas develop because of damage

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:18.472
to the DNA of cells called melanocytes.

00:00:18.976 --> 00:00:21.472
The damage results in cells that no longer

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.984
grow or die in a structured way.

00:00:24.168 --> 00:00:26.608
Melanocytes produce the skin pigment

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.960
melanin that gives our skin color.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.096
A melanoma forms in these cells

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:32.968
below the surface of the skin.

00:00:33.312 --> 00:00:35.232
The rapidly growing cells work

00:00:35.232 --> 00:00:37.230
upwards to the skin surface

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.016
and appear on the surface as a dark mole,

00:00:40.112 --> 00:00:43.072
usually with a botchy irregular border.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.336
ou can reduce your risk of melanoma

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.280
by avoiding excessive exposure to

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.872
ultraviolet or UV radiation

00:00:49.872 --> 00:00:51.870
from the sun or tanning beds,

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.304
using a broad-spectrum sunscreen

00:00:54.392 --> 00:00:57.360
and wearing protective clothing when in the sun.

00:00:57.496 --> 00:01:00.712
Itâ€™s also a good idea to have a regular skin exam

00:01:00.864 --> 00:01:03.360
and report any changes to your doctor.
