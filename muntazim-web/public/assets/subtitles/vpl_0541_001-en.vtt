00:00:00.168 --> 00:00:01.904
A nail becomes ingrown

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.584
when it grows into the skin,

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.856
or the skin grows over the edges.

00:00:06.184 --> 00:00:08.016
Cutting your toenails too short

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.336
or trimming them too closely on the sides,

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.016
rather than straight across,

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:14.296
can encourage the nail to curl down

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:16.048
and grow into the skin.

00:00:16.376 --> 00:00:18.656
An ingrown toenail may become sore,

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.376
red, and infected and produce a small amount of pus.

00:00:22.624 --> 00:00:25.408
Wearing shoes or hose that are too tight

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.112
or high heels can also set the stage

00:00:28.112 --> 00:00:30.110
for an ingrown toenail.
