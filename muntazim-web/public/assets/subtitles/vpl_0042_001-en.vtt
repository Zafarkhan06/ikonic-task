00:00:00.264 --> 00:00:03.296
Your spine is made up of bones called vertebrae,

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:04.800
separated by small,

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.328
circular cushions called disks.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.848
Disks have a soft, rubbery center

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.888
and a fibrous outer layer.

00:00:12.032 --> 00:00:13.656
They act as shock absorbers

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:14.968
when you move your back.
