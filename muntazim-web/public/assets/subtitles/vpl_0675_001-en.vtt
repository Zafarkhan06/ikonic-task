00:00:00.192 --> 00:00:02.568
During Week 4 of pregnancy,

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.728
the single cell zygote divides

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.736
many times to form a ball of cells,

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.256
with an inner group and an outer shell,

00:00:10.256 --> 00:00:12.250
known as a blastocyst.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.968
The blastocyst reaches the uterus

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.536
and within a couple of days,

00:00:16.536 --> 00:00:18.530
implants itself in the wall.
