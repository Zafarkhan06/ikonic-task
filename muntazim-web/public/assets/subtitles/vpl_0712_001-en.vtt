00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.432
If you have type 1 diabetes,

00:00:02.576 --> 00:00:05.416
your body does not produce a hormone called insulin

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:07.912
in response to blood glucose levels.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.080
Glucose is a form of sugar,

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.496
formed from the breakdown of foods we eat,

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.416
especially carbohydrates.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:15.792
Whenever you eat,

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:18.496
the level of glucose in your blood rises.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.344
Normally, glucose attaches to cells on the pancreas.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.136
This triggers the cells to produce insulin.

00:00:25.376 --> 00:00:27.184
The insulin enters the bloodstream 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.344
and attaches to receptors on cells 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.472
throughout your body.

00:00:30.608 --> 00:00:32.952
This allows glucose to enter the cells

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.576
and be used for fuel.

00:00:34.896 --> 00:00:37.232
If you have type 1 diabetes,

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.176
your immune system has destroyed

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.024
the cells that produce insulin.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.376
Without insulin, 

00:00:42.536 --> 00:00:44.936
the glucose can’t move into cells,

00:00:45.104 --> 00:00:47.952
so blood levels of glucose become very high.

00:00:48.064 --> 00:00:50.960
This condition is called hyperglycemia.

00:00:51.136 --> 00:00:53.832
Because the glucose in the blood can’t be used,

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.336
it spills into the urine

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.088
and passes out of the body. 

00:00:57.304 --> 00:01:00.336
The inability of cells to get glucose for fuel,

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.944
and the loss of glucose in the urine,

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.480
results in weakness, weight loss,

00:01:05.584 --> 00:01:07.576
and excessive thirst and hunger.
