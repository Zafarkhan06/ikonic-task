00:00:00.192 --> 00:00:03.160
Tonsillitis is a common childhood ailment.

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.688
It refers to inflammation of two clumps of

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.656
tissue in side walls at the back of the throat.

00:00:08.656 --> 00:00:10.650
The tonsils are made up of spongy

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.800
tissue containing white blood cells,

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.400
which defend the body against disease.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.488
Some experts think the tonsils

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.392
filter bacteria and viruses

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.552
entering through the nose or mouth.

00:00:21.864 --> 00:00:23.864
If the tonsils become infected,

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.224
they can become swollen and painful.

00:00:26.376 --> 00:00:28.768
In severe cases, swollen tonsils

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.304
project into the throat

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.240
and can prevent swallowing or passage of air.

00:00:33.392 --> 00:00:35.888
When tonsils become inflamed too often,

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.344
some experts recommend their removal,

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.664
in a procedure called a tonsillectomy.
