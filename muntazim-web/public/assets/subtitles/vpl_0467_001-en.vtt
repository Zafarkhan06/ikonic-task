00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.912
The uterus is a hollow organ

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:03.824
located in a woman’s pelvis

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:05.864
between the bladder and rectum.

00:00:06.136 --> 00:00:08.144
Fibroids are noncancerous

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.000
growths of cells from the muscular

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.880
layer of the uterine wall.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.248
A fibroid’s location can affect

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.248
both symptoms and treatment.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.064
Three primary types are

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.736
fibroids on the outside wall,

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.112
called subserous;

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:22.576
partly in the cavity

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:23.968
and partly in the wall,

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.576
called submucosal;

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.696
and penduculated fibroids,

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.712
which are connected to the uterus by a stalk.

00:00:31.184 --> 00:00:34.224
Many women have single or multiple fibroids,

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.352
sometimes of different types.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.032
They range in size from as

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.208
small as a pea

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.264
to larger than a cantaloupe.

00:00:41.704 --> 00:00:44.016
Fibroids often cause no symptoms

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.688
and are often only discovered

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.392
because of a pelvic exam or

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.512
ultrasound for another reason.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.088
Some women,

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.912
particularly those with submucosal fibroids,

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.384
experience prolonged,

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.320
heavy menstrual bleeding.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.432
Subserous tumors sometimes

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.624
press on the bladder,

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.376
causing urinary symptoms

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.960
or on the rectum, causing constipation.

00:01:05.272 --> 00:01:07.704
A fibroid pressing on the spinal nerves

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.920
can cause back or leg pain.

00:01:10.144 --> 00:01:11.904
Fibroids can also cause

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.776
pelvic pain or pressure.

00:01:14.128 --> 00:01:16.776
There are many treatment options for fibroids,

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.512
including watchful waiting,

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.832
medications, and surgery.
