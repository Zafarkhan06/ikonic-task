00:00:00.272 --> 00:00:02.384
Nasal saline irrigations help

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:04.040
to prevent build up of mucus

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.024
in the nose, sinus passages, and throat.

00:00:07.136 --> 00:00:09.248
This may help prevent asthma attacks

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.944
and sinus infections.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.232
The method used for these irrigations

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.088
depends on your childâ€™s age

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.352
and comfort level.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.640
If your child is an infant,

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.216
put 10 to 20 drops (0.5 to 1 ml)

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.968
of normal saline into one nostril.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.464
Then suction out the mucus

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.712
and saline with a bulb syringe.

00:00:28.832 --> 00:00:31.360
Repeat the procedure in the other nostril,

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.808
and then repeat in both

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.832
nostrils if necessary.

00:00:35.224 --> 00:00:37.056
For a young child who can blow her

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.000
own nose but needs some help,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.056
gently squeeze normal saline

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.512
from a nasal spray bottle

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.144
into one nostril.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.376
Then have her sniff

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:46.808
and blow her nose.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.304
Repeat this in the other nostril.

00:00:49.864 --> 00:00:52.232
An older child who does not need help

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.944
can follow the same procedure as adults:

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.424
Lean over a sink,

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.280
cup some saline in the hand,

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.504
and sniff into one nostril.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.144
Or instill the saline into one nostril

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.336
with a bulb syringe

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.024
or nasal spray bottle.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.328
Then blow the nose gently.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.424
Repeat with the other nostril.
