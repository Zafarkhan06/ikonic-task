00:00:00.528 --> 00:00:02.768
The final stages of food digestion

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.680
take place in the large intestine or colon.

00:00:05.872 --> 00:00:08.744
After nourishment is extracted from what we eat,

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.440
the leftover waste material mixed with water

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.576
flows from the small intestine into the colon.

00:00:15.024 --> 00:00:16.570
After entering the colon,

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.416
stool loses water as it

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.864
travels upward through the ascending colon

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.808
and across the belly through the transverse colon.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.472
As water is lost,

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.360
stool returns from a liquid

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.512
into a solid

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.544
as it goes down toward the rectum

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.128
in the descending colon.

00:00:32.312 --> 00:00:35.208
Stool is moved through the sections of the colon

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.280
by waves of squeezing muscles

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.888
in an action called peristalsis.

00:00:40.128 --> 00:00:41.792
Constipation can occur if

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.104
too much water is absorbed from the stool

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.648
or if peristalsis is slowed down.

00:00:47.032 --> 00:00:49.600
Many other factors can also play a role,

00:00:49.712 --> 00:00:52.240
such as a poor diet low in fiber,

00:00:52.432 --> 00:00:54.008
emotional stress,

00:00:54.144 --> 00:00:56.136
or other medical conditions.
