00:00:00.424 --> 00:00:02.616
Your circulatory system controls

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.272
the flowâ€”or circulationâ€”of blood.

00:00:05.368 --> 00:00:07.968
The center of this system is your heart.

00:00:08.136 --> 00:00:09.696
Normally, when your body is at

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.208
a comfortable temperature,

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.960
blood flows in an even and continuing loop

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.552
to and from your heart,

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.072
through blood vessels throughout your body.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.192
Exposure to cold temperatures

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.848
causes a shift in blood circulation.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.952
Blood flow to your extremities is

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.584
reduced to maintain your core temperature

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:28.896
and to protect organs

00:00:28.896 --> 00:00:30.890
such as your heart and brain.
