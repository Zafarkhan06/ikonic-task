00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.440
Histamine antagonists or antihistamines,

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.460
are drugs that relieve allergy symptoms.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.960
Histamine is a chemical used to identify and remove

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.480
substances that trigger an allergic response.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.900
There are four histamine receptors,

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.500
designated H1, H2, H3, H4.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.860
When histamine activates H1 receptors

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.260
symptoms such as rashes, itching, watery eyes

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.500
and trouble breathing may begin.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.940
Antihistamines prevent histamine from stimulating

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.180
the H1 receptors located in the eyes, nose and throat,

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.860
to relieve swelling and stop leaking fluid.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.440
First generation antihistamines

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.460
were non-selective for H1 receptors

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.400
and crossed into the brain, resulting in drowsiness.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.540
Newer antihistamines are more selective, reducing this side effect.
