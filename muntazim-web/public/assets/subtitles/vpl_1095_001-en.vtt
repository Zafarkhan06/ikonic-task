00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.240
Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis are both

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.540
types of inflammatory bowel disease.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.000
They share some symptoms

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.280
but affect different areas of the digestive tract.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.420
In Crohn’s disease any part of the digestive tract

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.620
can be affected, but it most commonly affects the

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.620
end of the small intestine and the beginning of the large intestine.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.440
Inflammation can be continuous or may be patchy.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.120
It often spreads into deeper layers of the bowel wall.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.500
Crohn’s disease can cause diarrhea,

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.740
abdominal pain, fatigue, weight loss and malnutrition.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.060
Symptoms vary between people.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.560
Some people may experience only mild or occasional symptoms

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.400
and for some it can be very painful

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.660
and sometimes may lead to life-threatening complications.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.920
There is no cure for Crohn’s disease,

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.120
but treatment can reduce its signs and symptoms.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.140
Ulcerative colitis causes inflammation and sores

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.020
in just the lining of the large intestine and rectum.

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.780
The inflammation is usually uniform and continuous.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.860
Symptoms of ulcerative colitis include diarrhea,

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.720
often with blood or mucus,

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.660
rectal bleeding, abdominal cramps and pain,

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.700
fatigue, and stool urgency.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.820
Most people with ulcerative colitis have mild to moderate symptoms

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.000
and some have periods of remission.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.320
Ulcerative colitis can be debilitating and sometimes

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.660
may lead to life-threatening complications.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.100
There is no cure for ulcerative colitis,

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.840
but treatment can reduce its signs and symptoms

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.380
and offer long-term remission.
