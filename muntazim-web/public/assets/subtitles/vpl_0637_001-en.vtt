00:00:00.888 --> 00:00:03.088
The term “atherosclerosis”

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:04.784
refers to the build up of

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.688
fatty, waxy deposits called plaque in arteries.

00:00:08.984 --> 00:00:11.008
The arteries are the blood vessels that

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.328
carry blood containing

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.592
oxygen throughout the body.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.680
If the build up of plaque is large enough,

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.968
blood flow can be reduced.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.904
If the plaque breaks off or ruptures,

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.760
a blood clot forms.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.216
It can completely block the artery

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.936
or travel to another part of the body.

00:00:30.328 --> 00:00:32.936
Most people think about atherosclerosis

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.640
in relation to the heart.

00:00:34.768 --> 00:00:37.656
Reduced blood flow in the coronary arteries

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.688
can cause symptoms like chest pain and fatigue

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.160
and blocked blood flow results in a heart attack.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.080
But atherosclerosis is a systemic disease

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.296
and the same process can occur in

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.368
any artery in the body.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.000
Build up of plaque in the carotid arteries,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.968
which supply blood to the brain,

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.848
can result in a stroke.

00:00:59.832 --> 00:01:02.456
Atherosclerosis in the major arteries

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.968
supplying blood to the arms, legs, and pelvis

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.360
can result in peripheral arterial disease.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.240
Blockage of the renal arteries,

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.736
which supply the kidneys,

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.096
can result in kidney failure.

00:01:15.744 --> 00:01:18.600
Many scientists believe atherosclerosis

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.256
begins with damage to the endothelium

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.768
the inner most wall of the artery.

00:01:24.024 --> 00:01:26.832
Preventing and treating atherosclerosis

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.760
includes addressing factors that

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.232
promote this damage,

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:31.992
including cigarette smoking,

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.288
high blood pressure,

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.256
high cholesterol levels, and diabetes.
