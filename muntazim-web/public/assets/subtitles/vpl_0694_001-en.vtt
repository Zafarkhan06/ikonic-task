00:00:00.416 --> 00:00:02.816
Uterine prolapse means the uterus

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:04.432
falls from its normal position

00:00:04.432 --> 00:00:06.430
above the vaginal canal. 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.016
There are different levels of severity.

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:10.872
In the beginning the uterus may

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.696
only drop slightly into the vaginal canal,

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.848
without causing any symptoms.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.176
As prolapse becomes more severe,

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.784
the uterus moves lower in the canal.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:21.968
Some of the uterus,

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.936
and eventually the entire uterus,

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.072
may be outside the vagina.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.032
As the uterus moves further 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:30.568
down the vaginal canal,

00:00:30.656 --> 00:00:33.592
it can put pressure on the bladder or bowel.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.448
Symptoms can include problems with

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.488
urination or bowel movements,

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.472
lower back pain, and a feeling of

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.976
heaviness or pulling in your pelvis.

00:00:42.224 --> 00:00:44.496
Prolapse results from weakening or

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.200
tearing of the muscles and ligaments

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.784
that normally hold the uterus in place. 

00:00:48.888 --> 00:00:51.280
Women who experience uterine prolapse

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.136
have usually had one or more vaginal births,

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.656
particularly of large babies.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.600
Other factors that can contribute include

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.664
loss of muscle tone with aging

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.592
and lack of estrogen after menopause.
