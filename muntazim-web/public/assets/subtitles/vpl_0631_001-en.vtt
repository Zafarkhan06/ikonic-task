00:00:00.296 --> 00:00:01.952
Although thyroid cancer is

00:00:01.952 --> 00:00:03.950
not as common as other types,

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:06.024
the number of newly diagnosed

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.080
cases has been increasing.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.792
This is attributable in part

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:11.976
to better diagnostic tools.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.264
Women seem to be at particular risk

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.424
for reasons that are not yet clear.

00:00:16.504 --> 00:00:18.608
Your thyroid gland is located

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.096
in your neck under your Adamâ€™s apple.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.688
It is shaped like a butterfly with one wing

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.360
or lobe on either side of the trachea,

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.064
which is your breathing tube.

00:00:28.208 --> 00:00:30.160
It is highly vascularized,

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.520
meaning there are many blood vessels.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.680
This is because the thyroid gland

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.176
produces hormones that are carried throughout

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.392
your body through your blood stream.

00:00:39.568 --> 00:00:42.000
These hormones affect many aspects of

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.496
how your body functions,

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.184
such as your heart rate and metabolism.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.128
Early on, thyroid cancer typically

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.888
does not cause symptoms.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.072
But as it grows, it can cause

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.832
symptoms that include hoarseness,

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.104
coughing, and trouble swallowing.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.616
If it grows large enough,

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.280
it can cause a visible lump on your neck.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.280
If you have these symptoms,

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.440
see your doctor to investigate possible causes.
