00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.328
Too much cholesterol can be deadly,

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.512
but it is also one of the essential

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:06.200
building blocks of life.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.272
Most of the cholesterol in your body

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:09.824
is made in your liver from

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.712
carbohydrates, proteins, and fat.

00:00:13.288 --> 00:00:15.736
About 25% comes from animal

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.512
proteins you eat that contain cholesterol,

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.608
like meat and egg yolks.

00:00:20.792 --> 00:00:23.152
After food is broken down in the stomach,

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.496
it moves into the small intestine.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.880
Fats, or lipids, are further broken down into

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.472
particles that can be absorbed

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.360
into the intestinal lining.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.184
Inside the cells lining the intestine,

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.496
cholesterol is reconfigured into

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.144
droplets inside a layer of protein

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.768
to form lipoproteins called chylomicrons.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.104
The chylomicrons are released into a network

00:00:47.104 --> 00:00:49.100
called the lymphatic system,

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.744
which transports them to the blood stream.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.920
They are then carried to the liver,

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.680
where they are absorbed by cells

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.280
called hepatocytes.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.240
Inside the hepatocytes,

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.672
the cholesterol is repackaged into

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.032
forms the body can use, like HDL.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.360
These particles are released into the bloodstream

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.112
to be used by cells throughout the body. 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.072
A major route for eliminating cholesterol

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.040
is through secretion into bile

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.752
as bile acids.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.568
Bile helps your body digest fats.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.504
It is made in the liver and stored in the gallbladder.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.664
When needed, it released into the

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.360
small intestine to help with digestion.
