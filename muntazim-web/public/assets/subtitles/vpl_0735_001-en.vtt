00:00:00.144 --> 00:00:02.208
Canker sores are open sores

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.936
that occur inside the mouth.

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:05.072
They are not related to

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.448
fever blisters or cold sores.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.512
Cankers are typically caused by a

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.928
viral infection, stress, hormonal changes,

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.600
menstrual periods, food allergies, vitamin deficiencies,

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.912
mouth trauma or by a weakened immune system. 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.168
This mouth ulcer typically starts

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.872
as a small bump that may cause a

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.032
tingling or burning sensation.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.792
Within a day or two, a small red blister rises.

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.576
It develops into a shallow white or yellowish

00:00:32.576 --> 00:00:34.570
open wound with a red border,

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.600
usually about one centimeter in size.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.272
Just before beginning to heal,

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.120
the sore may turn gray.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.520
The pain and wound usually subside

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.344
within 7 to 10 days,

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.552
although it can take up to three weeks for a

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.704
canker sore to completely heal. 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.856
Canker sores usually do not require treatment.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.512
They go away on their own

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.928
and they do not cause cancer.
