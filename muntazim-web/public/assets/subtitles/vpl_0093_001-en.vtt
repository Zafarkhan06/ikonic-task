00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.168
The human heart is a muscle

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.552
that acts as a pump.

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:05.648
It contracts and relaxes

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.064
each time it beats.

00:00:07.184 --> 00:00:08.888
The heart has 4 compartments

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.008
or chambers.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.432
The upper chambers are called Atria

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.192
and the lower chambers are called Ventricles.

00:00:15.368 --> 00:00:17.192
These chambers fill with blood

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.512
which is then pumped throughout

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.528
the body to supply nourishment

00:00:20.712 --> 00:00:23.208
The heart has 4 thin, flexible valves

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.008
which open and close to control

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.232
the flow of blood with each heartbeat.

00:00:27.432 --> 00:00:30.176
The 4 valves are the Tricuspid valve,

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:31.784
the Pulmonic valve,

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.104
the Mitral valve,

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.968
and the Aortic valve.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.632
The Mitral valve is made of

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.808
2 tissue flaps called leaflets

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.728
and is located between the Atrium

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.128
and Ventricle on the left side of the heart

00:00:43.288 --> 00:00:45.184
Mitral valve prolapse

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.968
is an abnormal bulging of

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.672
the Mitral valve when the heart contracts.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.624
When one or both of the leaflets

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.800
bulge backwards into the Atrium,

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.744
the valve may not always close completely.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.912
When it does not close all the way

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.648
the Mitral valve allows

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.080
small amounts of blood flow

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.584
backward in your heart

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.784
and is known as regurgitation.
