00:00:00.376 --> 00:00:02.096
The oxygen and nutrients your

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:03.552
brain needs to function

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:04.992
are carried in blood through

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:06.720
blood vessels from the heart.

00:00:06.864 --> 00:00:09.064
If problems in the blood vessels reduce

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:10.960
or cut off this blood flow,

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.288
the brain tissue quickly dies.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.536
This is known as a stroke.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.552
Symptoms differ depending on

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.752
which area of the brain is affected.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.928
There are 3 different mechanisms for strokes.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.816
In a thrombotic stroke,

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.920
a blood clot forms at a narrowed

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.272
or damaged area in an

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:29.728
artery to the brain.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.584
In an embolic stroke,

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.112
a blood clot in another

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.928
part of the body breaks loose,

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.496
travels through the body,

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.400
and becomes stuck in an artery to the brain.

00:00:39.768 --> 00:00:41.616
In a hemorrhagic stroke,

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.248
an artery ruptures,

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.664
and blood leaks out into the brain,

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.424
which prevents blood from getting to

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.032
the brain tissue in the surrounding area.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.544
Hemorrhagic strokes usually occur

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.664
in those with high blood pressure.
