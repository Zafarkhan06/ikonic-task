00:00:00.232 --> 00:00:01.952
When a woman is pregnant,

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:04.120
her pelvis begins to tip backwards

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:05.672
as the baby develops,

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.440
to balance the forward weight

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.408
of the expanding uterus.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.192
As the pubic and tailbones move backward,

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.032
the arch in the lower back increases. 

00:00:15.208 --> 00:00:17.696
As the lower back arch increases,

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.208
so does the curve in the

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.240
upper back or thorax.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.472
The shoulders and head move forward

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.056
and the chest collapses

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.240
to balance the changing weight.

00:00:27.472 --> 00:00:29.544
All these changes can increase

00:00:29.552 --> 00:00:31.008
stress on the spine,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.816
exaggerating its natural S shape.

00:00:33.968 --> 00:00:37.152
Other muscles and ligaments can also be strained.
