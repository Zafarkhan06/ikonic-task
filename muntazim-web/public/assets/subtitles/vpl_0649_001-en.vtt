00:00:00.152 --> 00:00:01.752
Many people have heard of the

00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:03.720
fight or flight response.

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.768
It refers to a set of nerve and hormone signals

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.232
 that cause physical changes to help us deal with danger.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.960
It is produced by a part of your

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.312
nervous system that works automatically,

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.736
called the sympathetic nervous system.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.664
When you encounter almost anything challenging,

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.888
a tiny region at the base of your brain

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.480
called the hypothalamus

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.056
releases a hormone called

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.424
corticoreleasing hormone, or CRH.

00:00:28.568 --> 00:00:30.672
This hormone travels a short distance

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.408
to the pituitary gland at the base of the brain

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.952
and triggers release of another hormone

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.912
known as adrenocorticotropic hormone.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.408
This hormone, also known as ACTH,

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.528
travels through your blood stream to your adrenal glands,

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.368
located just above each of your kidneys.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.016
ACTH stimulates the adrenal glands to release epinephrine,

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.968
also known as adrenaline,

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.448
norepinephrine, and cortisol.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.624
Together, these hormones produce the

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.504
physical changes associated with

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.624
the fight or flight response.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.544
Your heart rate and breathing rate increase.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.296
The sweat glands on your skin

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.552
become more active and your pupils dilate.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.216
Goosebumps occur when nerve signals cause

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.040
tiny muscles attached to hair follicles to contract.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.176
The hair follicles rise above the rest of the skin,

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.872
and these tiny elevations

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.248
are what we call goose bumps.
