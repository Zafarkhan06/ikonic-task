Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or ADHD agents

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.420
are most often stimulants that increase alertness,

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.600
wakefulness, focus and concentration.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.860
They help when neurotransmitters between neurons within the brain

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.660
are unable to send signals past the synapse.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.460
This inability to transmit signals

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.980
is due to the existence of too few transmitters

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.980
or because the neurotransmitters are recycled too quickly.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.400
Thus inhibiting the transmission of the signal to the next neuron.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.500
This decreases the ability to concentrate or focus.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.160
ADHD stimulants increase the amount of neurotransmitters between neurons

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.100
by either releasing more neurotransmitters from the synapse

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.700
or blocking or slowing their recycling process.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.880
This increases the signal's effectiveness between neurons

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.980
and makes the pathways in the brain more efficient,

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.780
thus improving the ability to concentrate or focus.
