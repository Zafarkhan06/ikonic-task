00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.496
Your body responds to stress via

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.496
hormones produced by the adrenal glands.

00:00:06.008 --> 00:00:08.768
The glands and their release of hormones

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.256
are controlled in part by the brain.

00:00:11.424 --> 00:00:15.416
A small area called the hypothalamus produces hormones,

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.248
which stimulate another part called the pituitary gland.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.704
This gland releases other hormones into the circulation,

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.424
which stimulate the adrenal glands. 

00:00:25.608 --> 00:00:28.960
The adrenal glands are located on top of the kidneys.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.816
They produce hormones that, among other things,

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.048
create our physical reactions to stress.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.240
For example, your heart rate increases when the

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.616
adrenals produce more adrenalin.

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.768
You become less sensitive to pain

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.048
when cortisol production goes up.

00:00:45.192 --> 00:00:47.496
Chronic stress can increase levels of

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.280
cortisol for prolonged periods.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.704
This can have many negative effects

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.288
such as increased abdominal fat.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.096
Excess fat in this area

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.392
is associated with more health problems

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.360
than fat deposited in other areas.
